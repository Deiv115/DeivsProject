Since 2011, the SXSW team has also been hosting\u00a0 SXSWedu\u00ae&#8211;a four day conference and festival held immediately prior to SXSW. Class Central attended the SXSWedu the last two years (you can read our coverage for <a title=\"MOOC Takeaways from the 2014 SXSWedu in Austin, TX\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/mooc-sxsw-edu-2014\/\">2014<\/a> and <a title=\"MOOCs Bringing an Increased Focus on Teaching in Campuses\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/swsxedu-2015-moocs\/\">2015<\/a> here), though unfortunately we weren&#8217;t present in 2013 when The New York Times writer Laura Pappano moderated a conversation between Coursera co-founder Andrew Ng and edX President Anant Agarwal.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IzhgRPp9yrY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>PanelPicker<\/h2>\n<p>At this year&#8217;s conference, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sxsw.com\/sites\/default\/files\/attachments\/sxsw-2015-statistics.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">357 sessions <\/a>were hosted by the conference.

Thus, it is probably a good bet that these professionals benefited from Udacity Nanodegree credentials to achieve their career goals. In the past year, Udacity has created new Nanodegrees including those for Android and iOS development, and Udacity also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/udacity-nanodegree-50-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced a 50% tuition reimbursement <\/a>program for students who complete a Nanodegree within 12 months.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/panelpicker.sxsw.com\/vote\/48802\">You can get more details and vote for the Udacity session\u00a0here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The Common Theme: Credentials<\/h2>\n<p>In 2015, we have seen credentials around MOOCs pick up a lot of steam &#8211; Specializations, Nanodegrees, and Xseries. edX with their <a title=\"A Big Step in MOOCs for Credit?

The discussions in all the panels mentioned above will be based on these credentials and their impact. Our makeshift crystal ball tells that in the next few months, the focus of MOOC providers will be in further planning, developing, and raising awareness around these credentials.<\/p>\n<p>Class Central will be watching and keep you updated on events and news.
