It is part of the Microsoft Office suite containing other software like Word, PowerPoint, and Access among others. Not only Windows, Excel can also be run on Android, MacOS, and iOS.<\/p>\n<p>Excel is widely used for performing simple to complex calculations and data visualization (that is creating interactive graphs and charts from your data). It also comes with a built-in programming language called VBA or Visual Basic Applications. VBA is a special programming language you can even use to manipulate data on the spreadsheet which is otherwise difficult to do!<\/p>\n<p>In Excel, data is stored in \u201ccells\u201d formed by the intersection of rows and columns. Like many other spreadsheets, Excel can be used to organize data and perform arithmetic operations. Excel is used in many fields such as science, engineering, finance and simple daily calculations.<\/p>\n<h3>Why are Excel skills important?<\/h3>\n<p>Since Excel has such a wide variety of uses, it\u2019s only natural that it\u2019s a much sought-after skill. According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/807830\/No_Longer_Optional_Employer_Demand_for_Digital_Skills.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) of the Government of UK<\/a>, Microsoft Excel is one of the most common productivity software skills requested by UK employers. With the highest number of job adverts of 810,239, a high advertised salary of \u00a331,300 and a versatility of 0.98 (very high), Microsoft Excel has a projected growth rate of 23% in the next 5 years.<\/p>\n<p>In the US too, millions of jobs require you to have Excel skills. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.burning-glass.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Digital_Edge_report_2017_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research by Burning Glass Technologies and Capital One<\/a> has found that having digital skills leads to better employment and higher income. In fact, the impact is actually more not on sophisticated skills such as writing code but on using software such as spreadsheets.<\/p>\n<p>Different jobs demand different levels of Excel proficiency. Be it simple data manipulation, core financial calculations, or advanced subskills of Excel such as VBA and pivot tables, Excel finds its way into just about every job aspect. Regardless, fluency in Excel makes you more versatile and is definitely a plus for your career.<\/p>\n<h3>What is my experience with Excel?<\/h3>\n<p>I am a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/instructor\/archisha-bhar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guided Project Instructor<\/a> at Coursera, my first Guided Project being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/projects\/problem-solving-using-microsoft-excel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Problem Solving using Microsoft Excel<\/a> (currently unavailable). I am also a Beta Tester at Coursera, having tested many courses before they\u2019re officially launched (including one in this list).<\/p>\n<p>I have taken <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@archisha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 50 online courses<\/a> in various subjects. My experience as an online learner and teacher has given me some perspective on what to look for in an online course. I used my experience to evaluate each course in this list.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-79248\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/h2>\n<h2>Course Ranking Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology I used in previous rankings (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>). It involves a three-step process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Research:<\/b> I started by leveraging Class Central\u2019s database with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subjects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100K+ online courses<\/a> and 200K reviews.

There are practice opportunities at every step of the course. And to make the process more fun, they will take you through Sean\u2019s Excel journey. Who\u2019s Sean? Well, it could be you!<\/p>\n<p>This unique storytelling way of teaching makes your learning more personalized. Though originally intended for business, this course will teach you the building blocks that are applicable to any scenario. So, don\u2019t be scared by the course\u2019s name if you don\u2019t come from a business background!<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course starts with the basics of the Excel user interface and terminology, including selecting and navigating data using shortcuts and tools. From there, you&#8217;ll move on to perform data entry, editing, and deleting, which are often overlooked but essential skills to have. This course will give you a better understanding of the different data types and how to work with them.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll dive into Excel formulas and functions, which are powerful tools that allow you to perform various tasks quickly. You&#8217;ll learn how to write syntactically correct functions and perform simple calculations with cell referencing and the order of operations. You&#8217;ll also learn how to format your spreadsheet, including font formatting, bordering cells, aligning data, and changing number types. You&#8217;ll also learn how to work with data in Excel, including finding, replacing, sorting, filtering data, and highlighting specific data with Conditional Formatting.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you&#8217;ll end the course by creating graphs and charts in Excel. You&#8217;ll learn how to modify and style your graphs and charts to make them more attractive and effective.

By the end of this course, you&#8217;ll have all the skills you need to manage data, perform calculations, and visualize information in Excel.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is broken down into 6 weeks. Each week involves about 3 to 4 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos and a lot of practice exercises.<\/p>\n<p>Remember Sean? Each week, you\u2019ll be presented with a challenge Sean faces with Excel. The instructors, Nicky and Prashan, will sit together to discuss Sean\u2019s problems in depth. This will be a great opportunity for you to gain deeper insight into each week\u2019s topic.<\/p>\n<p>Lessons are taught in the form of practice videos. Practice makes permanent! That\u2019s why, after each video, there\u2019s an ungraded practice quiz to test your understanding. And that\u2019s not all! At the end of each week, there are practice challenges in the form of Excel files where you\u2019ll work on finding the solutions in Excel itself.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there are graded quizzes at the end of each week that will contribute towards your final score in this course.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Institution<\/td>\n<td>Macquarie University<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Prashan S.

I instantly became a fan of the instructor\u2019s teaching style, and proceeded to take his next two courses, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/everyday-excel-part-2-19571\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everyday Excel, Part 2<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/everyday-excel-projects-33463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everyday Excel, Part 3 (Projects)<\/a>. So if you\u2019re looking for an interactive instructor, you should definitely check this one out!<\/p>\n<p>Many Excel courses use complex examples with large volumes of complex financial or scientific data that many of us might not be familiar with. But Charlie Nuttelman uses very simple and goofy examples to grab the learner\u2019s attention. Even if he ever uses technical examples, he makes sure that the focus is on Excel and not on the subject.<\/p>\n<p>As a civil engineering student, I find it really thoughtful that he, as an engineer himself, emphasizes on the utility of Excel in this field. This is often overlooked in many courses, so it\u2019s definitely a thumbs-up from me!<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll start by learning the fundamentals of Excel. You&#8217;ll learn how to save and open files, navigate through worksheets using shortcuts, and understand the difference between cells, columns, and rows. You&#8217;ll also learn about cell formatting, conditional formatting, autofill, and fill series. We&#8217;ll teach you how to name cells and cell ranges, and introduce you to basic macro recording using VBA.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you&#8217;ll learn how to input mathematical formulas, and we&#8217;ll cover Excel&#8217;s syntax and order of operations. You&#8217;ll also learn how to troubleshoot by looking for errors and fixing them when you don&#8217;t get the expected result.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you&#8217;ll delve deeper into Excel functions. We&#8217;ll cover logical functions such as IF, AND, and OR, as well as advanced logical functions such as SUMIF, COUNTIF, and AVERAGEIF. You&#8217;ll also learn how to overcome limitations of autofill using text functions, and create your own user-defined function in VBA.<\/p>\n<p>After that, you&#8217;ll focus on data management in Excel. You&#8217;ll learn how to apply filters, create Excel tables, validate data, sort data, remove duplicates, and consolidate data from multiple sources. You&#8217;ll also get to learn one-way lookup functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you&#8217;ll learn how to present your data in the form of graphs and charts using data visualization in Excel. We&#8217;ll cover scatter plots, column charts, and pie charts, as well as other ways to visualize data such as pivot tables, slicers, and sparklines. You&#8217;ll also learn how to share Excel&#8217;s data with Word and PowerPoint, print your worksheets, and convert them to .pdf documents.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is broken down into 5 weeks. Each week involves about 4 to 5 hours of work. Concepts are taught through dozens of short videos.<\/p>\n<p>Charlie Nuttelman calls his videos \u201cscreencasts\u201d. These are demos that give step-by-step instructions on each topic. You can work alongside him by downloading the workbooks provided in the course. The explanations are easy to follow, and there are ungraded in-video quizzes (quizzes within the video) to check your understanding too.<\/p>\n<p>The quizzes in this course are somewhat unique. There are two types of graded quizzes in each week \u2013 the usual quizzes and the in-application assignments. For the latter one, you\u2019ll get an Excel file where you\u2019ll solve the problem on your own computer, and once you\u2019ve successfully found the solution, you\u2019ll get a \u201ccompletion code\u201d that you\u2019ll put into the quiz.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Institution<\/td>\n<td>University of Colorado Boulder<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Charlie Nuttelman<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level<\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workload<\/td>\n<td>25 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enrollments<\/td>\n<td>172K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rating<\/td>\n<td>4.7\/5.0 (2.5K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate<\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This course is part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/everyday-excel-33486\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Everyday Excel Specialization<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Charlie Nuttelman has another set of courses on Excel VBA \u2013 the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/excel-vba-creative-problem-solving-18887\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Excel\/VBA for Creative Problem Solving Specialization<\/a> (check out my review <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/review-excel-vba-problem-solving\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>!).<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">He is an award-winning professor, and one of the top instructors on Coursera, which he definitely deserves.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/everyday-excel-part-1-19327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-3\">3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-excel-fundamentos-y-herramientas-2962\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Excel: Fundamentos y herramientas (Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia)<\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80330\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80330\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80330\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.-Excel_-Fundamentos-y-herramientas-Universitat-Politecnica-de-Valencia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.-Excel_-Fundamentos-y-herramientas-Universitat-Politecnica-de-Valencia.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.-Excel_-Fundamentos-y-herramientas-Universitat-Politecnica-de-Valencia-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/3.-Excel_-Fundamentos-y-herramientas-Universitat-Politecnica-de-Valencia-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jaime Busquets Mataix, co-instructor of the course<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>My third pick for the best Microsoft Excel online course is the <b>free-to-audit with limited access<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-excel-fundamentos-y-herramientas-2962\"><i>Excel: Fundamentos y herramientas<\/i><\/a>, offered by Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia on edX.<\/p>\n<p>This course is one of Class Central\u2019s 250 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/collection\/top-free-online-courses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best online courses of all time<\/a>.

So if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, read on.<\/p>\n<p>Prediction or forecasting is important in many fields of work. By using a good prediction model, you can tell what your future sales will be, for example. Spreadsheets are a powerful tool in this matter. In spreadsheets, you can not only perform simple calculations and data visualizations, but can also build powerful forecasting models.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already seen or have access to Excel, it won\u2019t be difficult for you to actually build these models by yourself. This course will guide you through that process by first giving you an introduction to basic spreadsheet tools and formulas. Once you\u2019ve mastered that, you\u2019ll see how you can actually use Excel to predict future data.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>Week 1 is all about the basics of spreadsheets. You\u2019ll first get an overview of the history of spreadsheets. You\u2019ll learn about their basic capabilities, and how you can create models with them.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to navigate through a spreadsheet, understand different data types used in spreadsheets, spreadsheet notations for mathematical operations, and use built-in formulas and functions in spreadsheets. Other than that, you\u2019ll be able to write your own simple formulas, and troubleshoot common errors.<\/p>\n<p>In Week 2, you\u2019ll move from spreadsheet to model. You\u2019ll start off by organizing and laying out model elements, and learn about the types of objective functions and their use.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then take a look at the highly-used what-if analysis, sensitivity analysis, and other classic models such as basic cash flow models, sensitivity analysis, linear programming models and deterministic models. By creating assumptions, decision variables, and outcomes, you\u2019ll be able to create\u00a0 your own models that reflect real-world events.<\/p>\n<p>Week 3 deals with uncertainty and probability calculations using spreadsheets. You&#8217;ll learn about random variables, probability distributions, and power, exponential and log functions in model formulas.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also learn how to measure correlations between variables using spreadsheet statistical functions, and understand the results of functions that calculate correlations. You\u2019ll then take a look at\u00a0 models for calculating probability trees and decision trees, as well as use regression tools to make predictions.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in Week 4, you\u2019ll learn about Monte Carlo simulations and linear programs in spreadsheets. These are models widely used for simulation and optimization of real-world scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll see how you can run Monte Carlo simulations in spreadsheets, understand the different types of problems you can solve with linear programs, and implement\u00a0 all this in spreadsheets. You\u2019ll learn to model uncertainty and risk, use Excel\u2019s solver tool for optimization, and take a look at the differences between Excel and Sheets.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is broken down into 4 weeks. Each week involves about 1 to 2 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos and readings.<\/p>\n<p>The video lectures are moderately short, giving hands-on demonstrations on solving real-world problems in Excel. The readings consist of lecture slides, Excel files of the examples shown in the videos, and external links to useful resources.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of each week, there\u2019s a graded quiz to test your understanding.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Institution<\/td>\n<td>University of Pennsylvania<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Don Huesman<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level<\/td>\n<td>Mixed<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workload<\/td>\n<td>26 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enrollments<\/td>\n<td>96K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rating<\/td>\n<td>4.2\/5.0 (3.5K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate<\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>One Thing to Note<\/h3>\n<p>Even though this list is for Excel, this course is applicable to other spreadsheets too such as Google Sheets.

So whether you are someone who wants to learn Excel from scratch, or someone who is somewhat familiar with Excel, this course will help you master the skills required to analyze data in Excel.<\/p>\n<p>Starting at the very basic level, this course builds on simple operations and functionalities to more advanced features of Excel. The course structure is simple, and teaches all the topics you need to know to use Excel for any purpose effectively.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>In Week 1, you\u2019ll be introduced to spreadsheets. You\u2019ll see how you can read data into Excel, and manipulate data in Excel, including arithmetic manipulation. You\u2019ll also learn about basic spreadsheet operations and functions, including functions using relative and absolute referencing.<\/p>\n<p>Next, in Week 2, you\u2019ll learn how to organize data in Excel using spreadsheet functions. These include IF, nested IF (\u201cnested\u201d in any programming language means \u201cwithin itself\u201d; so this basically means IFs within an IF), VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions. These are advanced Excel functions, but popularly used to make data organization in Excel easier.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, in Week 3, you\u2019ll first brush up your skills on the VLOOKUP function and learn to use it across multiple worksheets. Then you\u2019ll understand data filtering in Excel, and construct and use pivot tables (powerful data summarization tools) to organize data. You\u2019ll also be introduced to creating graphs and charts in Excel for data visualization.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in Week 4, you\u2019ll end the course by learning more about graphs and charts in Excel. You\u2019ll learn about advanced graphs and charts such as\u00a0 line graphs, bar graphs and pie charts. You\u2019ll also take a look at pivot charts, scatter plots and histograms.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is broken down into 4 weeks. Each week involves about 3 to 4 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos and a lot of practice exercises.<\/p>\n<p>Each video is dedicated to a particular functionality of Excel. There is a good balance of theory and examples. The instructor, Sharad Borle, explains each topic briefly using slides before moving on to hands-on demonstration.<\/p>\n<p>After each and every video, there\u2019s an ungraded practice quiz to test your knowledge. This means there are ample practice opportunities in this course, which is definitely a plus point! Finally, at the end of each week, there\u2019s a graded quiz that adds to your final score.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Institution<\/td>\n<td>Rice University<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Sharad Borle<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level<\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workload<\/td>\n<td>20 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enrollments<\/td>\n<td>219K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rating<\/td>\n<td>4.7\/5.0 (9.3K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate<\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This course is the first of the five courses in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/business-statistics-analysis-18816\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Statistics and Analysis Specialization<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Borle has worked in India in the Department for International Development, Suzuki Motor Corporation and Network Limited.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/excel-data-analysis-7004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-8\">8. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/excel-for-the-99-85794\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Excel for Beginners (Davidson College)<\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80325\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80325\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80325\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/8.-Excel-for-Beginners-Davidson-College.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/8.-Excel-for-Beginners-Davidson-College.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/8.-Excel-for-Beginners-Davidson-College-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/8.-Excel-for-Beginners-Davidson-College-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80325\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kevin Smith, instructor of the course<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>My eighth pick for the best Microsoft Excel online course is the <b>free-to-audit with limited access<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/excel-for-the-99-85794\"><i>Excel for Beginners<\/i><\/a>, offered by Davidson College on edX.<\/p>\n<p>Like the previous courses on this list, this course is also no exception to teaching you the core foundations of Excel. As the instructor rightly points out, oftentimes, learning the fundamentals of Excel is overlooked and considered too basic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<i>But if we don&#8217;t master these aspects of Excel, it&#8217;s going to make our learning later on much more difficult and frankly, much less effective.<\/i>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I completely agree with him, and this is true for learning anything for that matter. That\u2019s why, in this course, he will take you through the basics of Excel so that you are much more comfortable with Excel than you imagined. Later on, you\u2019ll be able to build more advanced Excel skills upon this foundation in future.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>Week 1 is all about the absolute basics of Excel. You\u2019ll start from the ground up by learning how to open Excel on your computer, and familiarizing yourself with the Excel layout and interface. You\u2019ll also learn basic Excel terminology, and understand how spreadsheets are organized.<\/p>\n<p>Then you\u2019ll move on to the different data types Excel can handle and learn to format cells correctly. You\u2019ll also learn how to enter data in Excel, and explore some useful shortcuts that will help you perform common tasks efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>In Week 2, you\u2019ll learn how to visualize data in the form of charts. plots and graphs. It\u2019s often easier and more appealing to interpret trends and comparisons visually rather than quantitatively.<\/p>\n<p>So here you\u2019ll learn some of the common types of graphs and charts such as bar charts, scatterplots, pie and stacked column charts, and also combine different different plot types according to your needs.<\/p>\n<p>In Week 3, you\u2019ll move on to Excel formulas and functions. You\u2019ll see how you can summarize your data by calculating sums, counts, and averages using simple Excel functions.<\/p>\n<p>Then you\u2019ll learn about cell referencing in Excel which includes relative and absolute references. These are used in Excel formulas and functions to tell Excel which cells to work on. You\u2019ll also learn to sort and filter relevant data in Excel, and finally, end the week with conditional functions.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in Week 4, you\u2019ll put all your knowledge together and work with tables in Excel. You\u2019ll first learn how to convert data ranges to tables. Then, you\u2019ll learn to create pivot tables in Excel.<\/p>\n<p>Pivot tables are extremely powerful data summarizing and visualization tools, but can be difficult to use if you don\u2019t have a strong grasp of Excel foundations. Pivot tables can be used in complex problems, and you\u2019ll take a look at how to do that too.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is broken down into 4 weeks. Each week involves about 3 to 5 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos, readings and a lot of practice exercises.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of practice quizzes throughout the course. Real-world examples of different types are used in this course. The readings are helpful to summarize and gain deeper insights into the topics taught. Downloadable demo Excel files and datasets are also provided.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the course, there is a final course project. Here, you\u2019ll put all that you\u2019ve learned in this course to the test. You\u2019ll be given two real-world datasets, and you\u2019ll have to follow the instructions to summarize the data accordingly. Even though you can use any tool for this assignment, it is advised that you use pivot tables since they make data summarization a lot easier.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Institution<\/td>\n<td>Davidson College<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>edX<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Kevin Smith<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level<\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workload<\/td>\n<td>12 &#8211; 20 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enrollments<\/td>\n<td>25K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate<\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>One Thing to Note<\/h3>\n<p>Office 365 is used in this course.

And there\u2019s nothing better than learning Excel from the computer experts. So make sure to check this one out!<\/p>\n<p>A commendable feature of this course (as is the case with many IBM courses) is the use of something known as a \u201cHands-on Lab\u201d. These are fun practice exercises about which I\u2019ll talk more in the subsequent sections.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>In Week 1, you\u2019ll learn about the basics of spreadsheets, spreadsheet terminology, the spreadsheet interface, and navigating your way around worksheets and workbooks.<\/p>\n<p>Week 2 covers basic spreadsheet tasks such as viewing, entering and editing data, and moving, copying and filling data. You\u2019ll also take a look at the fundamentals of Excel formulas, and the most common functions used by a data analyst. You\u2019ll end the week by learning how to reference data in formulas.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, in Week 3, you\u2019ll learn about the importance of data quality. You\u2019ll learn about the fundamentals of data privacy, and how to import file data into Excel.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you\u2019ll understand how to remove duplicate and inaccurate data, and also remove empty rows in your data. You\u2019ll then learn to handle inconsistencies in your data, and finally, see the use of Flash Fill and Text to Columns features of Excel to manipulate and standardize your data.<\/p>\n<p>Week 4 deals with the fundamentals of analyzing data using spreadsheets. Here, you\u2019ll learn how to filter and sort data, and use some of the most useful Excel functions. You\u2019ll take a closer look at the VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP functions, and create and use pivot tables in Excel.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, in Week 5, there\u2019s a peer-graded assignment that will add to your final grade.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course is broken down into 5 weeks. Each week involves about 2 to 3 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos, readings, practice exercises and hands-on labs.<\/p>\n<p>The video lectures and demonstrations are professionally built, with an AI voice guiding you through the course. They present all the information to you clearly using quality presentations and examples.<\/p>\n<p>There are ungraded practical exercises throughout the course. Along with that, there are \u201cHands-on Labs\u201d too. These are ungraded practical exercises, but not in the form of quizzes. You\u2019ll first need to download the Excel file provided and then go through the instructions to solve the problems on your own computer.<\/p>\n<p>There are graded quizzes after each module, and at the end of the course, there is a peer-graded assignment. Once you complete the hands-on labs of Week 5, you\u2019ll have to submit those Excel files for your peers to evaluate.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Institution<\/td>\n<td>IBM<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Sandip Saha Joy, Steve Ryan<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level<\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workload<\/td>\n<td>12 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enrollments<\/td>\n<td>96.3K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rating<\/td>\n<td>4.8\/5.0 (2.8K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate<\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/excel-basics-data-analysis-ibm-21538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-10\">10. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/datacamp-data-analysis-in-excel-24399\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Analysis in Excel (DataCamp)<\/a><\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_80323\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-80323\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-80323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/10.-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-DataCamp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/10.-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-DataCamp.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/10.-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-DataCamp-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/10.-Data-Analysis-in-Excel-DataCamp-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-80323\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The process of data analysis in Excel<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>My tenth pick for the best Microsoft Excel online course is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/datacamp-data-analysis-in-excel-24399\"><em>Data Analysis in Excel<\/em><\/a>, offered by DataCamp.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the shortest one on this list, this course is no less productive than its preceding ones. Designed in a slightly different fashion, this course is actually broken down into three \u201cchapters\u201d. I\u2019ll talk more about how this works in the subsequent sections. And the coolest feature of this course is that you\u2019ll get to use spreadsheets on your browser!<\/p>\n<p>The instructor starts the course by telling a short story of how she came to use Excel. This is a nice personal touch since many of you will be able to relate to it and realize that learning Excel is not all that daunting!<\/p>\n<p>DataCamp understands that Excel is used as much in institutions as in companies. That\u2019s why they\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re ready with all the Excel skills that you need in order to be industry-ready.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The very first (free) chapter will take you through the very basics of Excel and using Excel to analyze data. You\u2019ll start off by looking at all the different things Excel is capable of, check out the data analysis steps, set up your spreadsheet environment, and navigate your way through worksheets.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll explore data in Excel, learn to look for exact matches, trim excess data, and sort data in tables. You\u2019ll then move on Excel functions, learn about nesting of functions, and understand the different types of data Excel can handle. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to classify data types, change other data types to text, and round off decimal values.<\/p>\n<p>In the next chapter, you\u2019ll move on to data cleaning and preparing text and date fields. You\u2019ll also learn about some of the most popular Excel functions including VLOOKUP. You\u2019ll begin by handling text data. This includes cleaning text data, joining text strings, capitalizing words, using upper and lower case, extracting text from cells, and replacing characters.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then work with date data by preparing date data, finding the day of the week, and figuring out the month. You\u2019ll then learn about some of the most essential functions in Excel, and use them to find matching columns, work with range_lookup, and finally, use the VLOOKUP function.<\/p>\n<p>In the final chapter, you\u2019ll use advanced Excel tools to analyze data. You\u2019ll work with the COUNT function and use it in different scenarios, and take a look at Excel\u2019s capabilities as a calculator. In other words, you\u2019ll learn to use the math functions of Excel. You\u2019ll also be able to use functions to find the minimum value in a dataset, and aggregate data.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then learn about the logic functions in Excel. You\u2019ll understand the arguments of the IF function, perform logical tests using the IF function, and apply it in more complex tasks. Then, you\u2019ll perform conditional aggregations, find unique values in a dataset, count projects, and determine the average of a set of values.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the course is broken down into three chapters, and each chapter contains several subtopics. Each chapter involves about 1 to 2 hours of work. Concepts are taught through a combination of videos and interactive quizzes.<\/p>\n<p>Videos are short, simple and easy to understand. There are two types of quizzes in this course: multiple choice and drag-and-drop. I found these really fun and different from the usual quizzes other courses generally have.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Provider<\/td>\n<td>DataCamp<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instructor<\/td>\n<td>Jen Bricker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Level<\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Workload<\/td>\n<td>4 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enrollments<\/td>\n<td>94K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certificate<\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>One Thing to Note<\/h3>\n<p>Only the first chapter, Exploring Data, has free access.
