Its creator, Yukihiro \u201cMatz\u201d Matsumoto, wanted to create an easy-to-read language that leveraged object-oriented programming for greater code reuse but also support multiple programming paradigms. The result was a human-friendly language with natural syntax that&#8217;s easy to pick up but could also become really complex when wielded by an experienced programmer.<\/p>\n<p>Although Ruby is a general-purpose programming language, it&#8217;s highly popular for developing rich web applications, especially with <a href=\"https:\/\/rubyonrails.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rails framework<\/a>. You can find many big name companies like Twitch, shopify, GitHub, and airbnb who built their products with it.

By the end of the course, you\u2019ll have a firm grasp of Ruby, including the object-oriented paradigm.<\/p>\n<p>No prior knowledge of programming is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course with the basics. You\u2019ll learn about variables and the different data types they can have, before moving on to getting user input and printing it to screen. Then, you\u2019ll be trained on conditional statements and loops. These constructs allow you to control the flow of the program to make decisions or automate repetitive tasks respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The first data structures you\u2019ll be introduced to are arrays and hashes. Data structures allow you to contain data in a certain \u2018shape\u2019. For example, arrays store sequences of data while hashes store pairs of data. You\u2019ll learn how to utilize these data structures effectively either through their in-built methods or by iterating through them with loops, perhaps by defining your own methods with blocks.<\/p>\n<p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code to improve readability. You\u2019ll learn a few best practices, conventions, and little tips to help you write clean, idiomatic Ruby. Afterward, you\u2019ll learn the similarities and differences between blocks, procs, and lambdas.<\/p>\n<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular paradigm especially when it comes to creating websites as it allows you to organize information and behavior in a program. You\u2019ll study classes, objects, and the key concept of inheritance. You\u2019ll then finish the course by exploring the more advanced aspects of OOP, like modules, mixins, and method privacy.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 10 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by going through the interactive tutorials and completing exercises which involve hands-on coding.<\/p>\n<p>If you have Codecademy Pro, you\u2019ll earn a certificate upon completing the course and have access to three portfolio projects to showcase your skills and quizzes to retain your memory of programming concepts.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Codecademy<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>10 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrolments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>315K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Codecademy was co-founded by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski, with the goal of giving\u00a0 anyone in the world the ability to learn the skills they\u2019d need to succeed in the 21st century.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">They offer free courses in 12 different programming languages, the most popular courses being Python, Java, C++, C#, and Swift.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/codecademy-learn-ruby-59923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-6\">6. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/freecodecamp-learn-ruby-on-rails-full-course-57811\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn Ruby on Rails (freeCodeCamp)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-82003\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/6.-Learn-Ruby-on-Rails-freeCodeCamp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/6.-Learn-Ruby-on-Rails-freeCodeCamp.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/6.-Learn-Ruby-on-Rails-freeCodeCamp-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/6.-Learn-Ruby-on-Rails-freeCodeCamp-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>freeCodeCamp\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/freecodecamp-learn-ruby-on-rails-full-course-57811\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Learn Ruby on Rails<\/i><\/a> teaches Ruby on Rails by guiding you through the development of a friends list app. You\u2019ll learn a lot about web programming and design in this <b>free<\/b> course.<\/p>\n<p>To take this course, you\u2019ll need some Ruby programming experience.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with an introduction to Ruby on Rails and its installation, before quickly starting work on your first webpage! You\u2019ll be taught about the Model-View-Controller pattern to help you implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. You\u2019ll then learn how to create new pages using the base template given to you.<\/p>\n<p>CRUD stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE. These operations are important to maintain persistent data in a database. You\u2019ll create a webpage that can display and modify data stored in an SQL database.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll style your web application with Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, so that the UI looks pleasing. This will also mean implementing different views of the same webpage, depending on whether the user is logged in or not. As you\u2019re making a social media website, users should be able to add other users as friends, so you\u2019ll implement that feature too. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how to upload your code to GitHub with Git and deploy the final product to Heroku.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 4\u20135 hours long.
