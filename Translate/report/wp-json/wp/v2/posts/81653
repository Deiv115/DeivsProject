It takes a hands-on approach towards learning: you\u2019ll learn by building lots of apps, either with templates provided by the course or completely on your own!<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll learn about SwiftUI, Apple\u2019s framework for building user interfaces with very little code, and Swift, a general-purpose, open-source programming language designed by Apple.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin the course by installing and getting familiar with Xcode, Apple\u2019s integrated development environment.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll cover the fundamentals of the Swift programming language: variables, data types, simple data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn some intermediate concepts, like structs that allow you to define the properties of your code and classes with properties that can be inherited by other code.<\/p>\n<p>After mastering the basics of Swift, you\u2019ll start building apps with SwiftUI by discussing some of the fundamentals of iOS development. Your first two projects consist of a check-sharing app that calculates bills and tips and a flag guessing app. You\u2019ll design the interface, make it interactive, and then add program logic to make it functional.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll build another three projects that involve handling user data and user errors, leveraging the power of machine learning, and creating and customizing beautiful animations. After that, you\u2019ll complete another three projects that cover the essential concept of states and bindings. Finally, you\u2019ll also have a taste of object-oriented programming and its relation to the overall app architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Another three projects (there are a lot of projects!) will be completed by you that\u2019ll deal more carefully with sending, retrieving, and storing data. It\u2019ll discuss data privacy, local storage, cloud synchronization, and efficiently fetching, processing, and displaying data.<\/p>\n<p>Controlling user view and UI flow are two essential components of iOS app development. You\u2019ll investigate integrating code from frameworks outside of SwiftUI (like UIKit and MapKit) and explore more ways of letting users interact with your apps through tab bars, gestures, haptics, and more. All of course, by completing projects.<\/p>\n<p>The final part of the course covers tips and techniques to help you build great apps, like split view layouts, layouts with transparent groups, formatting lists in text, and optimized for iPad.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 100\u2013200 hours long. To get the most out of this course, you are recommended to spend an hour each day reading or watching SwiftUI tutorials, or writing SwiftUI code. You\u2019ll learn by reading the lecture videos, course articles, and completing quizzes.<\/p>\n<p>The course comes with 19 projects (not including challenges that involve you building your own apps), along with review sessions spaced out over the 100 days that\u2019ll help you consolidate what you\u2019ve learned.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Hacking with Swift<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paul Hudson<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>100\u2013200 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackingwithswift.com\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paul Hudson<\/a> has written <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackingwithswift.com\/store\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many books<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackingwithswift.com\/store\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">courses<\/a>, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hackingwithswift.com\/unwrap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an app<\/a> on the Swift programming language.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">He also has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/paulhudson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a YouTube channel<\/a> where he discusses all things programming, especially Swift and iOS development.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/hackingwithswift-100-swiftui-98570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-2\">2. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/cs193p-developing-apps-ios-98573\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CS193p &#8211; Developing Apps for iOS (Stanford University)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-81663\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2.-CS193p-Developing-Apps-for-iOS-Stanford.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2.-CS193p-Developing-Apps-for-iOS-Stanford.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2.-CS193p-Developing-Apps-for-iOS-Stanford-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/2.-CS193p-Developing-Apps-for-iOS-Stanford-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My #2 pick for the best Swift course is Stanford\u2019s CS193p, originally offered to Stanford students but is now <b>freely available to all<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p><i>Developing Applications for iOS<\/i> explains the fundamentals of building iOS applications using SwiftUI. You\u2019ll build two sizable applications: a card game and a drawing software. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll be well-versed in Swift and SwiftUI programming.<\/p>\n<p>This course is not for complete beginners to programming. You\u2019ll need some experience with another programming language, preferably within the object-oriented paradigm.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by jumping right into building your first application: a card-matching game called Memorize. After that, it\u2019ll serve as the foundation for learning SwiftUI and Swift concepts, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Model\u2013view\u2013viewmodel<\/a> architectural paradigm, Swift\u2019s type system, enums, and optionals.<\/p>\n<p>Still within the context of Memorize, you\u2019ll explore property observers that observe and respond to changes in a property\u2019s value that can be wrapped with @State and @Viewbuilder. You\u2019ll then discuss protocols, the most important type in Swift, and see how generics and protocols can be used to design a better user interface. Afterward, you\u2019ll add animations to Memorize to truly bring it to life.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll begin a new project called EmojiArt, where you can draw a nice picture with emojis. Hence, you\u2019ll learn much about touch gestures like drag and drop. Several persistence topics will also be covered, along with error handling, before going over numerous properties wrappers and SwiftUI elements that help make SwiftUI programming easier.<\/p>\n<p>SwiftUI\u2019s document architecture allows you to turn EmojiARt into a multi-document application, which will enable you to create different works within EmojiArt. Then, you\u2019ll integrate UIKit functionality into your application to take advantage of some features not yet implemented in SwiftUI. Finally, you\u2019ll end the course by porting the iOS application to macOS.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 25\u201350 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos, going through the uploaded code demo, and completing the programming assignments that aim to test your programming skills.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Stanford University<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paul Hegarty<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>25\u201350 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td>388K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Likes<\/b><\/td>\n<td>11K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">There have been many iterations of CS193P, but it has only been uploaded freely on YouTube in 2020.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Apparently, Paul keeps a low social media presence such that even his Stanford website can only be accessed by Stanford associates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/cs193p-developing-apps-ios-98573\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-3\">3. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/raywenderlich-28797163-your-first-ios-swiftui-app-an-app-from-scratch-98822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Your First iOS &amp; SwiftUI App: An App from Scratch (raywenderlich.com)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-81662\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/3.-Your-First-iOS-SwiftUI-App_-An-App-from-Scratch-raywenderlich.com_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/3.-Your-First-iOS-SwiftUI-App_-An-App-from-Scratch-raywenderlich.com_.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/3.-Your-First-iOS-SwiftUI-App_-An-App-from-Scratch-raywenderlich.com_-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/3.-Your-First-iOS-SwiftUI-App_-An-App-from-Scratch-raywenderlich.com_-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a complete beginner to iOS and SwiftUI development and wondering how to get started, this <b>free <\/b>course is for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll start by learning the basics of SwiftUI, a new way for iOS developers to build user interfaces for their apps using Swift. You\u2019ll also dive into the Swift programming language itself, learning fundamentals like if\/else statements, variables, constants, type inference, and the Swift standard library. You\u2019ll add more cool functionality to your game and practice your new coding skills.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll even learn useful techniques you\u2019ll use as a developer in the real world, like App Architecture and Unit Testing!<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by telling you what you will build \u2014 a simple but fun game called Bull\u2019s Eye. Then, to help you get into the habit of understanding the project scope, you\u2019ll make a to-do list of all the things needed to develop Bull\u2019s Eye.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll explore SwiftUI, a framework for building user interfaces with very little code. Finally, you\u2019ll design the interface for your app, get a glimpse of the basics of object-oriented programming, and learn how to debug errors when they inevitably pop up.<\/p>\n<p>In the next part of the course, you\u2019ll work on making Bull\u2019s Eye interactive by wrapping your head around two essential concepts: state and binding. You\u2019ll then round off the section with some strings, variables, and app architecture basics. Additionally, you\u2019ll create a simple data model for the gameplay logic.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll take a deeper look at the Swift standard library, a library of functions written by Apple engineers that you can use in your Swift code. Finally, you\u2019ll use it to create a random target number in Bull\u2019s Eye.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll learn about unit testing that\u2019ll help you ensure that the Bull\u2019s Eye data model is working the way it should and see why test-driven development, incorporating unit testing into your daily workflow, is incredibly beneficial for productivity.<\/p>\n<p>In the course\u2019s final parts, you\u2019ll write the code to calculate the points for the game in a few iterations, from naive to ideal. Along the way, you\u2019ll learn about fundamental coding techniques with Swift, such as if\/else statements, variables versus constant, type inference, and much more, to end up with a complete functional (and fun!) game.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3 hours long, split into three sections.

In addition, you\u2019ll acquaint yourself with some of Apple\u2019s latest technologies: SwiftUI, ARKit, CoreML, and Create ML.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll start this course by setting up your developer environment, Xcode, and look at its interface builder. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to navigate and set up a new Xcode project to begin designing and developing an app that displays an image of coal with the title \u2018I am poor\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you are familiar with creating a static app interface, you\u2019ll want to breathe some life into it by developing a dice app and a Magic 8 Ball app. This will involve learning the Swift programming basics, like constants, variables, control structures, and data structures. You\u2019ll also learn how to create a responsive layout for your app.<\/p>\n<p>Diving deeper into the Swift language, you\u2019ll uncover some critical concepts behind object-oriented programming (OOP), like inheritance, structures, classes, and protocols. OOP forms the foundation for some software design principles. For example, you\u2019ll learn how to implement the Model View Controller design pattern and write organized, readable code when you create a choose-your-own-adventure game.<\/p>\n<p>The final few sections of the course cover advanced topics every professional iOS developer should know about. You\u2019ll start with networking, which involves making asynchronous API calls and communicating with the cloud, before moving on to persistent local data storage to store your app data locally, and, not to forget, learning to implement in-app purchases with the Apple StoreKit. Not only that, you\u2019ll also learn about Git, GitHub, machine learning, and augmented reality.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 60 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos, going through the course resource list provided, and most importantly, working hands-on on actual application projects.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Udemy<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Angela Yu<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>60 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>295K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.8 \/ 5.0 (78K)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Angela Yu is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/appbrewery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The App Brewery<\/a>, London&#8217;s leading programming bootcamp.
