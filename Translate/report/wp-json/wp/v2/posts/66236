In a typical flipped classroom, lectures are pre-recorded and can be watched online. The classroom time is used for other activities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In boths these pilots, there was no scheduled classroom time. The residential students did have access to optional office hours and a few other sessions, but the course materials had to be completely available online. At MIT, 36% of students never attended these office hours and about 35% attended only once or twice. Students took proctored exams, but the exams were done on the edX site on the student\u2019s own laptop. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A total of 27 students completed the MIT course, with 4 students dropping out very early in the course. At Georgia Tech, 54 out of 59 students went on to complete the online course.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src='https:\/\/gfycat.com\/ifr\/FavoriteFelineIndianskimmer#?secret=n8B85BGi9S' data-secret='n8B85BGi9S' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%'><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><em>Adaptive SmartBook used in CS 1301 O1. Published by McGraw-Hill and written by\u00a0David Joyner.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The MIT version did have proctored exams, but the exams were done on the edX site on the student\u2019s own laptop. The Georgia Tech course didn\u2019t have such a requirement. Here is what David had to say about his course:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>The course was designed such that credit isn&#8217;t contingent on any human component: a student can complete the class for Georgia Tech credit without ever having a human grade their work, proctor their exam, or answer their questions. In practice, most students do end up asking for help and interacting with classmates and TAs, but there&#8217;s no requirement to do so, which is what will allow the course to be opened as a for-credit MOOC as well (whereas right now they must be enrolled at GT).<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Students in his for-credit course as well as his edX MOOC could get direct help from David, by pinging him on Slack. David is also a prominent fixture in Georgia Tech\u2019s OMSCS, where he teaches multiple courses and also answers questions about OMSCS on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/DavidAJoyner\">online forums like <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/DavidAJoyner\">r<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/DavidAJoyner\">eddit<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>What does it mean for online students that MOOCs are being used on campus?<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>This is big news for online students<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these courses may look and feel like a typical MOOC, this is big news for online students. Usually the MOOC version of the course is different to the on-campus version. In some cases, the professors who teach a MOOC might not even teach the same course on campus. Also, there are many MOOCs that can be finished within a couple of hours, clearly much less time and effort than a student would spend on a semester-long course. In this case, on-campus students were taking the EXACT same course as MOOC students around the world, and they were earning credit. \u00a0Credit is a real world currency that society understands, acknowledges, and values. \u00a0When on-campus students use MOOCs to earn credit, it validates the rigors of the course and even improves the credibility of non-credit certificates. The fact that the on-campus students did most of the coursework on edX helps to validate the platform as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For both MIT and Georgia Tech, the results from both these pilots have been promising. Students in the online version at MIT rated the course as significantly less stressful than their on-campus classes. At Georgia Tech, based on test scores, no statistically significant differences were observed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT has published a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/odl.mit.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/PreliminaryAssessmentofMITonEdX.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">working paper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which provides detailed results of the pilot.

Georgia Tech hasn\u2019t published a paper, but this Insider Higher Ed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/digital-learning\/article\/2017\/08\/09\/georgia-tech-plans-extension-undergraduate-online-computer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provides more information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both these universities plan to offer their courses again with further tweaks and improvements. MIT plans to coordinate with the on-campus instructors and have students from both versions of the courses take the same exam. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\"
