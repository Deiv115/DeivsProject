With experience of Leuphana Digital School\u2019s first course \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/digital.leuphana.com\/courses\/thinktank-ideal-city-of-the-21st-century\/\">Think Tank \u2013 Ideal city of the 21st C<\/a>\u201d which I had attended back in 2012, I braced myself for the session. I was initially skeptical regarding the \u201csolutions\u201d part of the course, wondering how one could possibly learn to solve real problems, online.\u00a0The course offered by Zeppelin University and Leuphana Digital School in cooperation, had an asynchronous format and the relevant lectures &amp; readings were opened to participants during each assignment phase, with hard deadlines for team assignment submissions<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TV4Mgcrnn7Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Open to anyone!<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>For this Mooc, one didn\u2019t need to have design or innovation proficiency.

Anyone could attend as a participant or as a supporter. Before this course, however, I had attended a Mooc on Design thinking, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/designbiz\">Design Thinking for Business Innovations<\/a>\u201d; offered by Darden Professor Dr Jeanne Liedtka; \u00a0as well as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/cic\">Creativity, Innovation and Change<\/a>\u201d, \u00a0offered by Penn State University; both on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/cic\">Coursera<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Time is an essential prerequisite for participating fully in this innovation skill Mooc. Familiarity with the concepts such as change management or digital technologies, presented here, would have saved you some research and reflection time. But beyond that, most concepts were new for a first time innovation learner and may need more time than you have opted for.<\/p>\n<h2>Team building skills first<\/h2>\n<p>Each participant and supporter was assigned a team when they enrolled. Every team was allocated a mentor for \u201cdidactic\u201d evaluation and a tutor to chat about technical or other minor issues. Second week onwards, the participants could choose to re-team and many did. This wasn\u2019t the smoothest journey for everyone and soon the video on how to \u201cre-team\u201d found its way into the library. Reteaming was as real as teaming could get in real life.<\/p>\n<h2>An impressive panel of experts<\/h2>\n<p>Have you ever been taught a single subject by over a dozen experts in a period of 3 months or less? Imagine a hall where a single teacher is giving a lecture to a hundred students. Now imagine each of these hundred students learning from a dozen or so teachers, from the different universities across the world, looking at the same topic from diverse angles. And then these hundred learners team up and collaborate to create innovative solutions. That\u2019s the experience we got!<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Have you ever been taught a single subject by over a dozen experts in a period of 3 months or less?\u00a0<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The concept of collaboration was demonstrated in essence to us. While the face of the course was Prof Peer Ederer of the Zeppelin University; he would introduce the assignment and the speakers every assignment cycle and give instructions on how to attempt the assignment. The videos were short and concise; of generally 5-10 minute each and the concepts needed to be supplemented by resources available in the online \u201clibrary\u201d. Silvia Castellazzi, Bernd Eggers, Ulrich Eisert, Samuel Grieff, Ricardo Hausmann, Marco Iansiti, Thomas Lans, Ron Meyer, Ljubica Nedelkoska , Rolf Pfeiffer, Philipp Schmidt and Simon Weiderhold, were some of the dozen professors and experts from the field of Innovation who shared their research and expertise.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Peer-Ederer.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Peer-Ederer.jpg\" alt=\"Peer Ederer\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Peer-Ederer.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Peer-Ederer-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Course Material\/Content<\/h2>\n<p>While the first week assignment was a precursor to the essence of innovation, it did not have direct relation to the later assignments which were based on a case. In the second week, we were told to choose from two cases; one was a drone manufacturer, <strong>Aerovironment<\/strong>; and the second was <strong>Graphoid<\/strong>. We needed to identify innovative applications, one of which was to be elaborated upon in the coming phases.<\/p>\n<p>My first reaction was,<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\u201cHow? I don\u2019t understand either of these technologies.\u201d<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>But that was the \u201csomething\u201d that changed over the course.<\/p>\n<p>Over the period of the remaining nine weeks, we had four assignments where we were led through the entire process of innovation from exploration, selection of innovative concept, application of digital technologies and value creation. Teams needed to demonstrate how they had applied the concepts explained in the lectures. The second week was the most challenging. You needed to reteam, read the materials, decide on the case study and come up with innovative solution concepts, agreed upon all as a team. Team lab pages, once published, were open to all participants\/supporters and became a fertile learning ground for further ideation. Harvard professor, Ricardo Hausmann\u2019s \u201c<strong>Atlas of economic complexity<\/strong>\u201d and the concept of \u201c<strong>product space<\/strong>\u201d found itself as the most popular resource along with the \u201c<strong>Innovativeness Matrix<\/strong>\u201d, which was a unique tool to make decisions regarding the choice of innovation. Other topics explained ranged from dilemma structures, digital technologies revolution, opportunity identification, change management, lifelong learning, exploration and creativity, problem identification and collaboration.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Over the period of the remaining nine weeks, we had four assignments where we were led through the entire process of innovation from exploration, selection of innovative concept, application of digital technologies and value creation.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Grading &amp; Reviewing<\/h2>\n<p>While participation in this course was free of charge, one could also obtain university certificate with five credits, for a nominal fee. To be given a certificate, each team had to make five submissions which would then be graded by the mentors. Participants also had to evaluate automatically assigned team submissions each submission cycle. Further, peer assessments and commenting were encouraged by providing \u201cbadges\u201d for evaluation, although they were not counted towards the final grade.<\/p>\n<p>Deadlines were hard. We got two weekends and the entire week in between to work on each of our assignments. The mentors would remind us to \u201cpublish\u201d our work well in advance. Incase we \u201cforgot\u201d to save and publish the current assignment, the information in the \u201clab\u201d page would automatically be published at the Cinderella hour of the assignment.<\/p>\n<h2>Be prepared for hard work<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Anyone who thought they would juggle even another mooc, or complete the course on their mobile phone, would have needed to reconsider the thought.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It was exhaustive and that\u2019s the easiest term. So anyone who thought they would juggle even another mooc, or complete the course on their mobile phone, would have needed to reconsider the thought. \u00a0When you are doing a Leuphana digital Mooc, its always a good idea to push your current commitments to before or after the mooc, reschedule that vacation and find a baby sitter around the assignment submission weekends, if you have small kids. Same was true here. More than time, you need mental energy to deal with new concepts. You could of course, complete the mooc on your mobile or ithing in less than 5 hours a week, but to justify your learning, an effort of 10-15 hours a week would have been required, along with a desktop. Presentation is a strong component of the grading (almost 30% according to the rubric) and you would want to use a desktop or laptop to create and review your assignment submission in a sufficiently presentable manner, maybe with some visuals, charts or graphs. The lab page on the site provided some tools for editing, but it wasn\u2019t enough, if you really wanted to change the readability of your assignment, do some visual resizing or even for simultaneous editing by team members.<\/p>\n<h2>An exclusive community<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Prof. Peer Ederer himself was always there to answer the questions, if suppose it went unanswered by the forum TAs<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The community forum at the first glance was well organized and neat. There were some good discussions about the two cases initially and sharing of external resources too. Prof. Peer Ederer himself was always there to answer the questions, if suppose it went unanswered by the forum TAs, which actually was a rarity. \u00a0In case we had a direct question for the faculty, there was a subforum called \u00a0\u201cQuestions to Teachers\u201d where the teachers would respond back, and promptly. So if you had a question to Philipp Schmidt of MIT or to Ron Meyer of Centre of strategy and leadership; or any of the other experts, they were only a message or a question away. And they would answer!<\/p>\n<h2>In retrospect<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\u201cSolution and Innovation skills\u201d Mooc was equivalent to a brain shift. It doesn\u2019t just give knowledge; it strives to give skills to find and use the knowledge, you may not even have!<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>According to Ron Meyer, the way we think is the way we act. \u201cSolution and Innovation skills\u201d Mooc was equivalent to a brain shift. It doesn\u2019t just give knowledge; it strives to give skills to find and use the knowledge, you may not even have! For this vigorous course, you need to give it its due, by devoting the time and effort that it truly deserves. We were given a complex problem solving (CPS) test before the start of the course and have been told to compare our results by retaking the test after the course. Now, its time for me to retake that test. The mindshift, I sense, would have already happened.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Solving problems Through Innovation Through a Mentored Open Online
