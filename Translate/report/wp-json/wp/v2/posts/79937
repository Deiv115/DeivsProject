But now, you don\u2019t really know what to do with the knowledge and skills you\u2019ve learned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Just in case you actually don&#8217;t know these fields yet, AI is the field of computer science that focuses on allowing computers to demonstrate human-like intelligence. Machine learning is one branch of AI that deals with learning from large amounts of data.

And as it happens, there are countless, powerful ways to apply AI and machine learning. And by doing so, you can develop industry-relevant skills through projects that are not only useful, but fascinating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www3.weforum.org\/docs\/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Future of Jobs Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the World Economic Forum, AI and machine learning are expected to be some of the world\u2019s most in-demand skills through 2025.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Course Ranking Methodology<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous rankings (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can find them all here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). It involves a three-step process:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@manoel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and I (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@Elham\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@elham<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) started building this ranking by leveraging Class Central\u2019s database of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/subjects\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100K online courses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We took a look at things like ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks to make a preliminary selection.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This data-driven approach helped us sift through and pinpoint some of the best courses available out there. Most good courses don\u2019t go unnoticed. The very best tend to gather a lot of attention and excellent reviews!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, ratings and reviews don\u2019t always tell the whole story. Some courses may be outdated or archived. So the next step was to bring our personal knowledge of online education into the mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we used our experience as online learners to evaluate each of our initial picks. We bounced ideas off each other and made iterative improvements to the ranking until we were both satisfied with the end result.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We both come from computer science backgrounds and are prolific online learners, having completed about 45 MOOCs between us. Additionally, Manoel has an online bachelor\u2019s in computer science, and I am currently completing my foundation in computer science. Hence, AI and ML are topics we\u2019re both familiar with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, during our research, we came across courses that felt well-made but weren\u2019t all that popular. If we adopted a purely data-centric approach, we would have to leave those courses out of the ranking, if only because they had fewer enrollments and ratings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, we took a more holistic approach. We spiced up this list by including a wide variety of Applied AI &amp; ML courses to cater to a diverse range of learners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, our experience as lifelong learners, and lots of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking.

You\u2019ll start with the history and recent progress made in the field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you\u2019ll define what driving means and list out its element: all those things that you do automatically when you&#8217;re behind the steering wheel\u2009\u2014 identifying road signs, vehicles and pedestrians, predicting their actions, and all sorts of things that we take for granted!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As self-driving vehicles have emerged only recently, there is no one standard of system architecture. Hence, you\u2019ll go through the different ways to design a basic self-driving car hardware configuration, discuss a generic software stack to decompose the driving task into manageable components, and discuss how to represent the perceived environment for decision-making.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the self-driving domain matures, assuring the public and regulators that self-driving cars are safe becomes of more and more importance to self-driving developers (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2016\/02\/googles-self-driving-car-may-caused-first-crash\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remember when Google&#8217;s first self-driving car crash made the news?<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll study how to incorporate safety considerations into autonomous vehicle design, both in software and hardware. From there, we will move into vehicle modeling and control, like telling the car where it is, how fast it&#8217;s going, how to follow a desired route, and how to execute challenging maneuvers. Finally, you&#8217;ll test the limits of your control design and learn the challenges inherent in driving at the limit of vehicle performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 7 weeks long, with 35 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn a lot from the plethora of video lectures and reading materials provided by the course, along with weekly graded quizzes to test your knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will also be two graded programming assignments to complete, as well as a final project. The final project is a realistic hands-on project where you\u2019ll have to develop control code to navigate a self-driving car around a race track in the CARLA simulation environment, truly stretching your skills to the limits as well as being a great learning experience!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The graded assignments are only available to paying learners.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Toronto<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Waslander and Jonathan Kelly<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advanced<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">118K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.7 \/ 5.0 (2.7K)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Waslander is a leading authority on autonomous aerial and ground vehicles, including multirotor drones and autonomous driving vehicles.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He received his Ph.D. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University in 2007.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Kelly is the Director of the Space &amp; Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (STARS) Laboratory, where he has developed robots that fly, drive, swim, and grasp.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/intro-self-driving-cars-13140\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"2\">2. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/convolutional-neural-networks-9057\">Convolutional Neural Networks (DeepLearning.AI<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79939 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2.-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-DeepLearning.AI_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2.-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-DeepLearning.AI_.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2.-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-DeepLearning.AI_-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/2.-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-DeepLearning.AI_-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My second pick for the best applied AI \/ ML course goes to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/convolutional-neural-networks-9057\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convolutional Neural Networks<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0by DeepLearning.AI.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this course, you&#8217;ll understand how computer vision has evolved and explore its exciting applications\u2009\u2014\u2009from autonomous driving to face recognition to reading radiology images and more!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end of the course, you&#8217;ll be able to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks, apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks, and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data, all in TensorFlow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prerequisites of this course are intermediate Python skills and a basic grasp of linear algebra and machine learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins with the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are highly efficient at classifying image-based data. You\u2019ll learn all about the architecture and mathematics behind CNNs (wonder why they are called convolutional?), and then implement your own deep neural model to solve multi-class image classification problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have gotten the basics of CNNs down, you&#8217;ll explore and review several case studies about effective convolutional neural networks. You&#8217;ll look at a few models like the LeNet-5, the ResNet, and the Inception network to gain insight into the fascinating nature of these models. Computer vision research has advanced quickly in the last few years, and one of the best ways to write good code and have good ideas is by reading other people&#8217;s codes and ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Object detection is one of the areas of computer vision that has gotten so much better and more exciting recently. But first, object localization. Let&#8217;s say you see a cute cat. You recognize that there is a body of matter that is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cat <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surrounded by <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not-cat<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> things. That&#8217;s the problem object localization aims to solve.

By the end of the course, you\u2019ll know the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and when to apply them, select specific features for your model to train on, and write Python code to carry out an analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be successful in this course, you will need to know how to program in Python and be familiar with libraries such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins with an introduction to essential machine learning (e.g., supervised vs. unsupervised) concepts and how it is different from descriptive statistics. Then, you\u2019ll start with your first basic classification algorithm, k-nearest neighbors. You\u2019ll learn how k-nearest neighbors classify an unknown data point by looking at the closest points around it, and then, you\u2019ll implement the algorithm using the scikit-learn library.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second module, you\u2019ll dive into the supervised learning methods for classification and regression. An example of classification is figuring out if an animal is a cat or dog, while regression is predicting the price of a 100-room mansion. You\u2019ll learn an important lesson on model complexity and generalization. More complex models are more obscure to humans \u2014 it\u2019s hard to understand the reasoning behind its predictions \u2014 while more generalized models are great for a variety of ML tasks but suffer from being too mild in their predictions. Hence, you\u2019ll learn when to use one ML model over another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do we tell if our model satisfactorily predicts data? Module three covers the evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models. For example, you\u2019ll learn how accuracy can be a misleading evaluation of model performance when you learn about false positives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final module discusses more advanced supervised learning methods: tree ensembles and neural networks. You\u2019ll study how these different algorithms tweak their own parameters using data to improve their predictions. Lastly, you\u2019ll learn to avoid the dastardly data leakage\u2009\u2014\u2009\u2019cheating\u2019 by giving your model information it shouldn\u2019t know and hence produces bias.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 4 weeks long, with 35 hours worth of material. The course provides many lecture videos and reading materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name of the course implies, you\u2019ll apply a lot of what you\u2019ll learn in the labs. If you are paying for the certificate, you\u2019ll have access to the weekly quiz and assignments which will drill in what the course instructors have taught you.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Michigan<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kevyn Collins-Thompson, Christopher Brooks, Daniel Romero, and V.

This content-packed course will give you insight into the fundamentals of analyzing images and extracting information from images. For example, you\u2019ll learn about feature detection, motion tracking, camera calibration, image stabilization, and so much more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course, you\u2019ll need to know some data structures (I have a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/best-algos-data-structure-courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data structures ranking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) and have good working knowledge of MatLab and\/or Python with NumPy. You also require some math, like linear algebra and vector calculus, and experience with signal processing is helpful but not necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course is structured into 10 units: Introduction; Image Processing For Computer Vision; Camera Models and Views; Features and Matching; Lightness and Brightness; Image Motion; Motion and Tracking; Classification and Regression; Miscellaneous Operations; Human Vision.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can think of computer vision as being a relationship between three ways of thinking: computational model, algorithms, and real images.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Computational model is the math behind processing images, algorithms are the implementation of the math, and lastly, real images are the application of the algorithm. The course goes through all three aspects, especially the last one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, you\u2019ll do some image processing because you have to manipulate images to do a variety of types of interaction with them later. You\u2019ll also need to learn about the geometry of cameras and camera models, and what happens when you have multiple views and how you can relate them to each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ascending to a high-level view, you\u2019ll be introduced to features, which is computing something about one image and figuring out where in the other image those same features occur. Once you get that down, there&#8217;s a lot you can do in terms of thinking about either transforming images or computing geometry between them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does light interact with material before it arrives at your imaging sensor to produce a beautiful picture? The course spends some time talking about how images are formed in the first place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Videos are essentially sequences of images, so defining motion entails defining how pixels between images change which will then enable us to start tracking the object.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course also discusses a little bit about machine learning, like classification and recognition, but the bulk of the courses is dedicated to computer vision as it pertains to traditional AI rather than machine learning and deep learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 16 weeks long, as it includes a lot of video lectures that are well-produced. There are also multiple practice quizzes you can complete to test your understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of this course is its emphasis on practical application. Often, real-world images have their own little issues and quirks that confuses even the most advanced of algorithms. Hence, a lot of perseverance and experimentation are necessary to get good results. You\u2019ll experience this first-hand in the 8 problem sets provided.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Georgia Institute of Technology<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Udacity<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irfan Essa, Aaron Bobick, and Arpan Chakraborty<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">16 weeks long<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 4.8K bookmarks on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Irfan_Essa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irfan Essa<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the instructor, is a Distinguished Professor of Computing at Georgia Tech.

But texts are hardly tangible objects, so how do we represent text as features to feed our machine learning algorithm? To handle this, you\u2019ll turn text into vectors and feed the vectorized text to a classifier that will tell if they have positive or negative connotations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another thing you\u2019ll learn in this course is vector space models which captures semantic meaning and relationships between words. Okay, let me put that simply: when I say the word dog, you might think of \u2018canine\u2019, \u2018bark\u2019, \u2018bite\u2019, \u2018wag\u2019. Vector space models help teach a computer this linguistic intuition, which will help them in search-related applications like information retrieval, indexing, relevancy ranking, and information filtering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final section of this course touches on something fascinating: machine translation and document searching. More specifically, you\u2019ll use locality-sensitive hashing\u2009\u2014\u2009putting words surrounded by other similar words into the same bucket.

Well, we could collect more training data, or train the algorithm model, or try a different optimization algorithm, or switch to a different model architecture, and the list of potential improvements goes on and on. A machine learning strategy acts as a distant lighthouse in a sea of time-consuming ideas \u2014 it points you in the direction of the most promising things to try and hence saves time, effort, and money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, you\u2019ll streamline and optimize your ML production workflow by implementing and following strategic guidelines before, during, and after the ML process. You\u2019ll set goals based on attainable metrics, split your dataset proportionately, compare your ML performance with human-level performance, recognize bias, variance, and data mismatch as it happens, and learn when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning in your project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 2 weeks long, with each week taking 5 hours to complete.

It focuses less on building new algorithms or proving theorems, favoring instead applying machine learning solutions to real-world problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ll be introduced to key terms and will learn how to come up with good machine learning problems. By the end of the course, you will be able to clearly define a business need as a machine learning problem and turn it into a machine learning application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning. AI. Data science. Deep learning. These are the latest buzzwords, but what do they all mean exactly? The course begins by clearing up the definition of each of these terms as well as some common misconceptions regarding them. Then, the course introduces you to the three kinds of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the aspects of machine learning. For example, you\u2019ll understand how machine learning differs from human learning. Afterward, you\u2019ll learn how to turn and refine a business need into a machine learning problem and get the raw data for the problem. Don\u2019t worry; plenty of examples will be provided in the lectures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Previously, you\u2019ve learned that machine learning can\u2019t happen without data. But where do we get data, and what kind of data? You\u2019ll answer these questions as well as discuss the ethical issues regarding the acquisition of data. Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about the data pipeline and why it is essential to have a squeaky clean pipeline.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course ends with the Machine Learning Process Lifecycle (MLPL), a framework that captures the iterative process of developing a Machine Learning solution for a specific problem. After understanding the MLPL, you\u2019ll analyze its application in a case study to get a glimpse of what a reasonable machine learning project might look like.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course includes 7 hours worth of material.

For instance, let\u2019s say we have a genetic condition that only affects 0.1% of humans. If we developed a model that correctly diagnoses patients 99.9% of the time, we might call our trial a success. But wait, the machine could just diagnose every patient as healthy, and it would still technically be correct 99.9% of the time! This is why we must be careful when taking a look at our data and how we can measure our model\u2019s performance, especially since someone\u2019s life might be at stake. The course will enlighten you with common challenges, pitfalls, and suggested strategies for handling these situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you work in healthcare, you\u2019re seldom alone. And you\u2019ll also work with many people from other disciplines and backgrounds.
