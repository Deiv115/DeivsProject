It was developed and released in 2013 by Meta for designing the user interface for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. But thanks to its open-source nature, it is also used by other big companies like Netflix, The New York Times, AirBnb, Discord, and DropBox, so it is easy to see why it is the most wanted-to-learn framework by developers for five years now, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/survey.stackoverflow.co\/2022\/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-and-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022 StackOverflow Survey<\/a>.

Then, after touring around your first starter project, you\u2019ll begin populating it with components to design your user interface. You\u2019ll also learn how to add style to your UI to make it user-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>So you\u2019ve designed a static webpage, but there\u2019s no interactivity yet. Events allow you to perform actions based on user input, like clicking. Actions can lead to change of states in components, so you\u2019ll learn how to manage them with hooks (and eventually create your own custom hook).<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll learn how to implement forms the user can fill in, which you can then use to send and receive data from a server. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn about the React router, handling errors like 404 pages, and more.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 3\u20134 hours long.

You\u2019ll start off with the basic features like JSX, props, states, refs, and components, which are the building blocks of any user interface. From there, you\u2019ll learn about lifecycle methods, handling user input with forms and events, and eventually making API requests to a server.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll learn about hooks in React \u2014 one of the most important React concepts you need to know. You\u2019ll learn why you should use hooks and when to use them in practice. And to put it all together, you\u2019ll develop a video-streaming application which you can then deploy to the web using Vercel or Netlify.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll dive into Redux, a state management library that makes creating complex applications straightforward. You\u2019ll dive into its source code and understand how it works behind the scenes. This way, you\u2019ll understand how to integrate React with Redux by taking advantage of Redux\u2019s async actions, forms, and dev tools.

It\u2019s designed to teach you everything you need to start building web applications in React right away. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll have deployed a fully-working React application to the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>To take this course, you\u2019ll need some experience with JavaScript and HTML\/CSS.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins by discussing why you should use React over vanilla JavaScript for creating websites. Then, you\u2019ll see what problems arise with plain JavaScript and how React solves those problems under the hood. In fact, you\u2019ll create a user interface with JavaScript and then with React to taste the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll learn JSX and how it translates to regular JavaScript function calls and objects. React components can help you simplify and reuse parts of your code, quickly cutting down on development time. Next, you\u2019ll learn how to manage the states of these components with hooks, another fundamental feature of React, and even know how to create custom hooks. You\u2019ll then learn how to build forms the user can fill in and make HTTP requests to a server once submitted before finally deploying your React application to the web with Codesandbox, GitHub, and Netlify.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 2\u20133 hours long.

After setting up VSCode, you\u2019ll set up the base for your course project by starting off with an index.html file. From there, you\u2019ll build a simple \u201cHello World\u201d React app with components to render text on the DOM, effectively creating a user interface. Components are reusable and flexible \u2014 you\u2019ll learn about the relationship between parent and child components and how it may affect design choices.<\/p>\n<p>After coding everything in Vanilla React, it\u2019s time to explore some essential JavaScript tools like npm to help you install packages, Prettier and ESLint to help you write clean code, Git for source code management, and more. Knowing how to use these tools will increase your productivity tenfold.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll learn about JSX to help you condense code even further. Hooks will help you manage states of components, and you\u2019ll learn about the many kinds of hooks. You\u2019ll also need to consider handling user input when building an interactive website, and you\u2019ll be drilled into the concepts needed to create a production-ready website.<\/p>\n<p>In the final parts of the course, you\u2019ll discover the enormous capabilities React offers, starting with React Router to manage browser navigation state along with error boundaries, context, and portals. Finally, the course wraps up by providing additional resources.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 7\u20138 hours long.

Some patterns may be more performance-heavy, so you\u2019ll be taught several tools and techniques to diagnose, profile, and fix performance issues in your React application. You\u2019ll also want to ensure that you\u2019ve thoroughly tested your app so that there are no nasty surprises for the end user.<\/p>\n<p>Asynchronous state management can be a doozy. Luckily, Suspense helps you keep clean, maintainable, simple, and readable code. You\u2019ll use Suspense and other popular tools in the final part of the course, where you\u2019ll build an application from scratch. The course will cover everything about building frontend React applications, from the absolute basics to the tricky parts you\u2019ll run into building real-world React apps.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 19 hours long and consists of 8 workshops. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos and trying out the hands-on interactive coding workshops.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Website<\/b><\/td>\n<td>epicreact.dev<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Kent C.
