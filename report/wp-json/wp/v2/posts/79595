For instance, you may implement a machine learning algorithm that can distinguish pictures of dogs from pictures of cats. Initially, the algorithm may not be very good at it. But as you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">train<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the algorithm by giving it examples of cats and dogs, it will learn to distinguish them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the ability to \u2018learn\u2019 is considered a sign of intelligence, machine learning is hence a part of artificial intelligence. And deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It has the same goal as machine learning (to make computers learn) but approaches the problem with neural networks. Now, what are neural networks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it simply, neural networks are made of neurons \u2014 but not neurons in the biological sense; we\u2019re talking about software neurons. We call them like that because they behave similarly to neurons in our brains \u2014 that is, they can receive, process, and pass information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neural networks aim to replicate through artificial intelligence this biological mechanism that allows the powerful mushy computer in our heads to see, speak, hear, and react. As it turns out, programming a computer to simulate some brain mechanism works! Deep learning is what powers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.deepl.com\/translator\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">translation software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/assistant.google.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">virtual assistants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deepfake\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deepfakes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Self-driving_car\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-driving cars<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lu56xVlZ40M&amp;list=PLujxSBD-JXglGL3ERdDOhthD3jTlfudC2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a whole lot more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see why companies are scrambling to find and incorporate AI and deep learning solutions into their products.

It involves a three-step process:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m a content writer for Class Central.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@Elham\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@elham<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), in collaboration with my friend and colleague <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/@manoel\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">@manoel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, began by leveraging Class Central\u2019s database of over 100K courses to make a preliminary selection of deep learning courses. We looked at indicators like ratings, reviews, and course bookmarks to bubble up some of the most loved and popular deep learning courses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we didn\u2019t stop there. Ratings and reviews rarely tell the whole story. So the next step was to bring our personal knowledge of online education into the fold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Second<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we used our experience as online learners to evaluate each preliminary pick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both of us come from computer science backgrounds and are prolific online learners, having completed about 45 MOOCs between us. Additionally, Manoel has an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/open-university-insiders-perspective\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online bachelor\u2019s in computer science<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while I am currently completing my foundation in computer science. Hence, deep learning is something both of us have struggled with!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By carefully analyzing each course and bouncing ideas off each other, we made iterative improvements to the ranking until we were both satisfied.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Third<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, during our research, we came across courses that we felt were well-made but weren\u2019t well-known. Had we adopted a purely data-centric approach, we would be forced to leave those courses out of the ranking just because they had fewer enrollments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So instead, we decided to take a more holistic approach. By including a wide variety of courses on deep learning, we hope this ranking will have something for everyone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After going through this process \u2014 combining Class Central data, our experience as lifelong learners, and a lot of editing \u2014 we arrived at our final ranking.

Experience in Python is also helpful but not necessary. If you want to learn or brush up on Python, check out my <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/best-python-courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python Courses ranking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course begins with\u2026 a welcome speech by Obama?!? Oh wait, it\u2019s actually Alexander Amini, the course instructor, somehow portraying himself as Obama! What a wonderful introduction to the field of deep learning!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn about several foundational concepts in deep learning, like how neural networks are just perceptrons\u2009(little computational gates that can let a signal through depending on conditions that can change over time)\u2009stacked on top of one another, optimized through backpropagation. You\u2019ll also learn how neural networks are trained by feeding them data, and the precautions we should take when training them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next module is on sequence modeling. From predicting the direction of moving objects to heartbeats to global temperature to natural language, sequences are everywhere. Recurrent neural networks are suited to deal with sequence modeling tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making computers see has always been an exciting idea. Unfortunately, computers see images as collections of zeroes and ones. How can we help computers find complex features in images then? Convolutional neural networks do the trick! You\u2019ll learn how models can learn to recognize features in images.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how did Alexander Amini manage to generate a realistic deepfake of himself as Obama? You\u2019ll find the answer in this section on generative modeling. Unlike the previous models where you apply labels to data (for instance, you tell the model that the image represents a cat), in generative modeling there is no label to begin with! This is called unsupervised learning, and its goal is to learn the hidden structure beneath data. You\u2019ll study two kinds of unsupervised models: Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you\u2019ve learned about supervised and unsupervised learning. Time to introduce you to a new category: reinforcement learning. And this is one of the great things about this course: it covers a lot of ground \u2014 not all deep learning courses touch on reinforcement learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reinforcement learning is the type of learning that enables <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CI3FRsSAa_U\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI to play Mario<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6qbW7Ki9NUc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">robots to walk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In reinforcement learning you have an agent placed in an environment with a desired goal to be achieved. Your agent then gets rewarded for certain tasks (the ones you want the agent to accomplish) and penalized for others. For there, the agent must iteratively learn a policy that maximizes rewards. That\u2019s reinforcement learning in a nutshell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course explores a few interesting prospects, like\u2009representing data with graph neural networks and automated machine learning, but there are limitations. For example, it is difficult for an AI to tell how confident it is in its predictions, and AI is also susceptible to bias, be it malicious or accidental. Fortunately, work is being done to hopefully prevent AI from doing more harm than good, and you\u2019ll learn how you can be a part of this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final few lectures in the course are taught by guest lecturers from respected institutions like Google and Nvidia. You\u2019ll be taught about learning for information extraction, taming dataset bias, AI for 3D content creation, and AI in healthcare.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 9 weeks long, with a total of 12 lecture videos that add up to about 10 hours of watch time. The lecture videos are well-produced and clear, and the supplementary resources are also handy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding assessments, there are plenty of software labs run in Google Colab. You\u2019ll learn by doing\u2009\u2014\u2009following along the instructor, writing code, and running it to see the magical results of deep learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MITOpenCourseWare<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructors<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexander Amini and Ava Soleimany<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beginner<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20\u201350 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Views<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.7M<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 782 bookmarks on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course\u2019s high production values are reminiscent of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science-442\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard\u2019s CS50<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/deeplearning.mit.edu\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIT\u2019s self-driving cars course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Then, you\u2019ll use NumPy to apply these concepts to create a neural network that predicts student admissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have programmed a neural network with NumPy, you\u2019ll see how pleasant it is to instead program with PyTorch! After an interview with Soumith Chintala, the creator of PyTorch, you\u2019ll focus on computer vision\u2009\u2014\u2009making computers understand images and videos. You\u2019ll learn about convolutional neural networks (CNN) that will allow you to classify images of cats, clothes, and dog breeds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time to get artistic!

This is called neural style transfer, and it\u2019s quite impressive: you can make any picture look like a painting, for instance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll see how recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be used to imitate sequential data like text. Moving into the field of neural language processing, you\u2019ll implement RNN to generate realistic text based on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/1399\/1399-h\/1399-h.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You\u2019ll also learn about sentiment prediction\u2009\u2014 determining whether a given text is positive, negative or neutral. You\u2019ll build another RNN to predict the sentiment of movie reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, you\u2019ll learn how to deploy deep learning models with PyTorch. PyTorch allows you to export your models from Python into C++.

PyTorch works best as a low-level library, while fastai adds a higher-level functionality on top of PyTorch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One cool thing about this course is that it teaches you how to set up a cloud GPU to train models on, as well as how to use Jupyter Notebooks to write and experiment with code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is designed for anyone with at least a year of coding experience (preferably in Python) and some memory of high-school math.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting with the first lesson, you\u2019ll learn what deep learning is and how it&#8217;s related to machine learning and regular computer programming. You\u2019ll look at critical machine learning topics and learn how to create production-ready models. This includes learning about confidence intervals and discussing the overall project plan for model development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time to create and deploy your own app! But before that, you\u2019ll discuss data augmentation and learn the underlying math and code of stochastic gradient descent. You\u2019ll build a GUI for your app, both for interactive apps inside notebooks and standalone web applications. You\u2019ll then learn how to deploy web applications that incorporate deep learning models.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll dive deep into the foundations of neural net functioning, by training a network from scratch. You\u2019ll learn about the sigmoid function, and see why it&#8217;s needed for classification models, along with a couple of handy features associated with arrays and tensors in Python. Then, you\u2019ll study how gradients are calculated and used in a PyTorch training loop. We go from a simple single-layer network, to create our first \u2018deep\u2019 network from scratch!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, machine learning models can go wrong. It is likely that at some point, you\u2019ll be put in a situation where you need to consider data ethics\u2009\u2014\u2009using data for good. The course discusses some useful ways to think about data ethics, particularly through the lens of a number of case studies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going back to deep learning, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the softmax activation function, used in most non-binary classification models. You\u2019ll then learn about multi-label problems\u2009\u2014\u2009why they can be useful even in situations where you expect each object to fall into just one category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision trees and ensembles of decision trees (random forests and gradient boosting machines) are often used for tabular data, and are much easier to explain and understand. But there are also some limitations of decision tree approaches, particularly in extrapolation, and you\u2019ll look at ways around this problem. Using these approaches, you\u2019ll arrive at a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kaggle.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaggle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> solution close to the top of the leaderboard in a popular competition!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final lesson of this course is all about natural language processing (NLP). Modern NLP depends heavily on self-supervised learning, and in particular the use of language models.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll learn how to tokenize and numericalize text data, as well as an approach called word embedding.\u00a0 You\u2019ll also be introduced to a new architecture known as recurrent neural networks. Lastly, you\u2019ll look at some tricks to improve the results of our NLP models.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are around 20 hours of lessons, and you should plan to spend around 10 hours a week on the course for 7 weeks to complete the material.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fast.ai<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeremy Howard<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intermediate<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">70 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The course has 28.8K bookmarks and 8 reviews on Class Central.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch\/dp\/1492045527\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the accompanying book for this course.

This course will not teach you everything about deep learning, but it will teach you just enough to get started on more advanced courses and learn independently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will learn about the different deep learning models and build your first deep learning model using the Keras library. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll be able to describe neural networks and deep learning models, understand unsupervised deep learning models (autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines) and supervised deep learning models (convolutional neural networks and recurrent networks), and most importantly, build deep learning models and networks using the Keras library.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To take this course you should have some Python programming knowledge and a little experience with machine learning.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll begin by exploring the exciting applications of deep learning, like restoring color in black and white photos and synthesizing audio. You\u2019ll learn about biological and artificial neural networks and how most of the deep learning algorithms are inspired by the way our brain processes data. Then, you\u2019ll learn about forward propagation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, you\u2019ll learn about the gradient descent algorithm and how variables are optimized with respect to a defined function. You\u2019ll learn about the brother of forward propagation, backpropagation, and how neural networks learn and update their weights and biases through this process. Finally, you&#8217;ll learn how activation functions work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now begins the more practical part of the course: Keras and deep learning libraries! You\u2019ll discover the different deep learning libraries: Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, but as the course name implies, you\u2019ll focus on building models using Keras.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the difference between shallow and deep neural networks? The next section of the course answers this question. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn what convolutional networks are and how to build them with Keras. You\u2019ll also learn about recurrent neural networks and autoencoders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final module is a course project. You\u2019ll end the course by working on a final assignment where you\u2019ll use the Keras library to build a regression model and experiment with the depth and the width of the model<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 5 weeks long, with each week taking 2\u20133 hours of study.

These concepts will help you understand linear regression and gradient descent, which you\u2019ll then implement from scratch using PyTorch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, you\u2019ll further your knowledge of linear regression and gradient descent. You\u2019ll work with the \u2018Hello World!\u2019 dataset of deep learning: <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/yann.lecun.com\/exdb\/mnist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MNIST<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a dataset of handwritten digits. Here, your aim is to determine what number an image represents. To accomplish this, you\u2019ll perform a training-validation split on the dataset, and learn about logistic regression. After that, you\u2019ll train, evaluate and sample predictions from your model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you\u2019ll move on to much more complex topics. You\u2019ll start by creating a deep neural network with hidden layers and non-linear activations. But training deep neural networks can be time-consuming, especially since you\u2019ll want to tweak certain hyperparameters and retrain your model again. So, instead of using your own GPU, you\u2019ll use cloud-based GPUs to handle all the computational work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So previously you used a regular deep neural network to determine the numbers in your dataset and saw how well that worked. You\u2019ll be surprised when you learn how convolutional neural networks are vastly superior at image classification! This will entail learning some key concepts though, like convolutions, residual connections, batch normalization and so on, as well as avoiding underfitting &amp; overfitting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, you\u2019ll get to the cream of the crop: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The additional prerequisite knowledge required in order to be successful in this course is a solid foundation in probability and statistics (e.g: standard probability distributions, probability density functions, maximum likelihood estimation).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first module is TensorFlow Distributions. Probabilistic modeling is a powerful and principled approach that takes account of uncertainty in the data. The TensorFlow Probability (TFP) library provides tools for developing probabilistic models that extend the capability of TensorFlow. You\u2019ll learn how to use the Distribution objects in TFP, and the key methods to sample from and compute probabilities from these distributions and make these distributions trainable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accounting for sources of uncertainty is a crucial aspect of the modeling process, especially when people are at stake such as medical diagnoses. Unlike most standard deep learning models, probabilistic modeling does not fail to neglect this. In the second module you\u2019ll learn how to use probabilistic layers from TensorFlow Probability to develop deep learning models that are able to provide measures of uncertainty in both the data, and the model itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Normalizing flows are a powerful class of generative models that models the underlying data distribution by transforming a simple base distribution through a series of bijective transformations. The third module teaches you how to use bijector objects from the TensorFlow Probability library to implement these transformations, and learn a complex transformed distribution from data. These models can be used to sample new data generations, as well as evaluate the likelihood of data examples.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the fourth module, you&#8217;ll learn how to implement the variational autoencoders (VAE) using the TensorFlow Probability library. In a VAE algorithm two networks are jointly trained: an encoder or inference network, as well as a decoder or generative network. You\u2019ll use the trained networks to encode data examples into a compressed latent space, as well as generate new samples from the prior distribution and the decoder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final module brings together many of these concepts you\u2019ve studied in the last four modules by giving you a task: Create a synthetic image dataset using normalizing flows, and train a variational autoencoder on the dataset. After completing the capstone project, you can proudly say that you have learnt quite a lot about probabilistic deep learning models using tools and concepts from the TensorFlow Probability library.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How You\u2019ll Learn<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is 5 weeks long, with 53 hours worth of material. There are plenty of videos and readings available for you to follow along.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assessments are only available for paying learners. In the assessments, you\u2019ll apply the concepts that you learn about into practice through practical, hands-on coding tutorials. In addition, there is a series of automatically graded programming assignments for you to consolidate your skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imperial College London<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kevin Webster<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advanced<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">53 hours total<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9K<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.7 \/ 5.0 (70)<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paid<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun Facts<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course is part of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/tensorflow2-deeplearning-21690\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TensorFlow 2 for Deep Learning Specialization<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/probabilistic-deep-learning-with-tensorflow2-21474\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"9\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/edx-machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to-deep-learning-11483\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine Learning with Python: from Linear Models to Deep Learning (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79608 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-Machine-Learning-with-Python_-from-Linear-Models-to-Deep-Learning-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-Machine-Learning-with-Python_-from-Linear-Models-to-Deep-Learning-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-Machine-Learning-with-Python_-from-Linear-Models-to-Deep-Learning-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/9.-Machine-Learning-with-Python_-from-Linear-Models-to-Deep-Learning-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you looked through all the previous courses and realized that you do not have a foundational grasp of machine learning, but do want to eventually learn about deep learning?
