Music students play together in ensembles, and many classes in the arts involve critical evaluation and feedback from peers and instructors. As students learn to critique the work of others, and to receive comments and suggestions, they also refine their skills and get ideas to adapt to their own future art-making.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teleconferencing applications and ideas adapted from social media can provide mechanisms for students to share and critique work. Many online courses provide or require \u201cpeer grading.\u201d C<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ourse galleries, student portfolios, and discussion fora\u00a0are woven into the instructional design of most courses at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kadenze.com\/\">Kadenze.com<\/a>, requiring students to share and provide meaningful comments and suggestions as part of their overall grade. Some online programs use Google Hangouts, Skype, or other systems to bring groups of students together. Many instructors regularly host virtual \u201coffice hours\u201d or online <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bkK6yr86sbE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AMA (Ask Me Anything)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sessions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many musicians and students have availed themselves of social\/mobile music-making apps to hone their skills and engage with others around the world. The popular <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/sing!-karaoke-by-smule\/id509993510?mt=8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sing!

Clearly, the influence and potential of the social space has just begun to be investigated and exploited in online music education.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much can still be done to push the envelope of real-time (or perceived real-time) interactions in music education. As mentioned in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/learning-music-online\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part 1<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0of our series, ideas from Stanford CCRMA\u2019s online course in networked musical performance could hold rich opportunities for high-fidelity music lessons; as could studio\/critique types of courses, where students and teachers (and robots\u00a0\u2014\u00a0see below) listen to and comment on each other&#8217;s work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A New Era: the Dawn of Robot TAs!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The area where technology can begin to make the most impact in music education is if\u00a0DSP (Digital Signal Processing) and Machine Learning (or Artificial Intelligence, or AI) are combined and added into the mix. When the (pre)internet first began, in order to find things online I had to use Gopher and Archie, then WebCrawler, and later Lycos or AltaVista. But things started to get really interesting when Google introduced true AI into web searches. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kadenze.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kadenze<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> make extensive use of our own machine learning algorithms and user\/instructor feedback displays to provide assessment and feedback on a large variety of media-rich assignment types, including sound\/music, images (photos and hand-drawn pictures), and videos. This fits particularly well for many music courses, where a sound or music file can be evaluated automatically, marked, and displayed back to the student with indications as to how well they did at executing the required criteria. Figure 1 shows auto-grader feedback for a music production assignment, highlighting differences from a perfect submission. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/robot-grader.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64076\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/robot-grader.png\" alt=\"robot-grader\" width=\"100%\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/robot-grader.png 421w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/robot-grader-300x279.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Figure 1: Robot grader student feedback for production mixing\/EQ assignment.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With machine-intelligent DSP-based music accompaniment software, some systems and companies have made strides toward attaining the elusive goal of private music instruction (or at least computer-mediated rehearsal). <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cs.cmu.edu\/~rbd\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roger Dannenberg<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (of CMU) has done seminal work on automatic music accompaniment systems, yielding\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.betterworldproject.org\/BetterWorldProject\/media\/Better-World-Reports\/Documents\/AUTM_BWP_2006_Tech_Transfer_Works_100_Cases.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SmartMusic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is licensed to Coda. These systems were installed in music studios and practice rooms, and could \u201clisten\u201d to the student, accompanying them and noting\/correcting mistakes as they were played. SmartMusic was then licensed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makemusic.com\">MakeMusic<\/a>! Inc. and sold as downloadable computer software (on a subscription model). Dannenberg now works with <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.musicprodigy.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music Prodigy, Inc<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. to provide computer\/mobile \u201cQuantified Music Practice\u201d applications. These allow students to rehearse their instruments with accompaniment, then transmit a machine-graded performance to their teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next installment of this series will delve specifically into how DSP and AI can bring music and arts assessment tools to online education at scale, allowing courses to be taken by thousands (or millions) of students at little incremental cost to the course creator(s) or platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Future?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Learning-Music-Online-II.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64083\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Learning-Music-Online-II.jpeg\" alt=\"Music Steaming Multimedia Listening Technology Concept\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Learning-Music-Online-II.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Learning-Music-Online-II-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Learning-Music-Online-II-768x513.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Learning-Music-Online-II-85x58.jpeg 85w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more music courses become available online, we might wonder if it could be possible to earn an entire degree without even putting on pants and going to town. Indeed, as we discussed in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/learning-music-online\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part I<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of this series, some schools already offer full degrees online. I envision a day (soon) when students can take a semester, a year, or even two years&#8217; worth of a music or other art degree online, and then transfer into one of many programs to complete their degree. Or, if a student wishes to stop there, they will still be more educated in music\/arts than most. If they\u2019ve availed themselves of some technology courses (programming, production, design, and so on), they might be ready for a job right then and there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some schools and programs, such as the Program in\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/caet.finearts.utexas.edu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arts and Media Technology at the University of Texas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, are developing new degrees where some subset of the courses will only be available online. Many others, such as the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.calarts.edu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Institute of the Arts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now use the online versions of some courses to \u201cflip\u201d their on-campus classrooms; in such courses, they instruct students to watch the lecture videos and do the assignments, and then to come to class to discuss, critique, and share ideas. Many other schools are investigating new models for segmenting and refactoring their courses and degrees into components that work best online, and keeping\u00a0other parts to be experienced in physical classrooms or studios.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The breadth of expertise and talent available in the knowledge leaders represented at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kadenze.com\/?utm_source=classcentral%20&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=prc_learning_music_online_post\">Kadenze<\/a>\u00a0by the combined faculty of all of our partner schools would be impossible to assemble within a single brick-and-mortar art\/music school. Only an online education platform could make such a &#8220;rock-star faculty\u201d possible. Combining the best topics, content, and teachers with state of the art technology that enables us to offer course content and graded\u00a0assignments (covered further in Part 3 of this series), there is massive new potential for teaching music and art to the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Perry R.
