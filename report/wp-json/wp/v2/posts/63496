It was\u00a0originally <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.udemy.com\/hey-grads-your-major-is-not-your-destiny\/\" target=\"_blank\">published here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>At 22, I hit one of my first major life milestones: I received my degree in chemical engineering. Those four years of hard work and late nights had led to this moment of celebration \u2014 yet something felt amiss. After pursuing and reaching goals for so long as a student, I no longer knew what the road forward looked like.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d just finished an internship where my job was to design safety valves for chemical reactors. I didn\u2019t find much joy in it. Instead, I was actually spending a lot of my time worrying that I was going to get someone hurt, or worse. Previously, I\u2019d thrown everything I had into chemical engineering, but now, at this late date, I realized I didn\u2019t want to make it my career.<\/p>\n<p>What I wish I could have told my anxiety-ridden, 22-year-old self is this: your major is not your destiny.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>What I wish I could have told my anxiety-ridden, 22-year-old self is this: your major is not your destiny.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In fact, your first job isn\u2019t your destiny either. I moved away from engineering and took a job with a big accounting firm, despite not knowing much about finance. After that I spent time at a venture capital firm, and then at an internet marketing startup.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, I was struggling to find my fit but, looking back, those early choices were good ones. I shouldn\u2019t have worried so much! In fact, what I picked up in my wanderings is the same advice I\u2019d share with today\u2019s new grads.<\/p>\n<p><b>Be patient:<\/b> You\u2019re eager, energetic, and full of ideas, but slow down and listen before you rush to present your thoughts to the board of directors. College isn\u2019t the end of learning; it\u2019s just the beginning of a new phase. Use your newcomer status to observe and soak up on-the-job lessons about your work environment, interpersonal dynamics, decision making, communication styles, and so on. Appreciate the transition from classroom to real world, and don\u2019t feel bad about not having everything figured out. You\u2019ve got time!<\/p>\n<p><b>Go broad:<\/b> Even if you think you\u2019ve nailed down your perfect career path, keep an open mind and expose yourself to as many different things as possible early in your working life. As I found from my experience in consulting, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. And you can\u2019t continue growing and evolving as a professional if you don\u2019t stay curious and receptive to new skills, new responsibilities, and new points of view. Now\u2019s the time for exploration and experimentation; you can specialize later.<\/p>\n<p><b>Get mentors:<\/b> \u00a0Now that I\u2019m a CEO, I don\u2019t get as many new hires approaching me directly for guidance. I suspect they assume I\u2019m too busy or \u201cimportant\u201d for such interactions, or they\u2019re afraid of looking green and clueless. All of that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I know from speaking with colleagues that we all feel an obligation to help when junior employees want to tap into our experience. We were all in their shoes at one point. So, don\u2019t be afraid to approach your senior coworkers and ask to chat over coffee. You may very well find a mentor for life.<\/p>\n<p><b>Always be learning:<\/b> If I had only one piece of advice, this would be it. Take a risk and try something unfamiliar while you\u2019re still new to the game. In fact, my other suggestions all add up to embracing a learning mindset. If you\u2019re taking the time to listen, venturing beyond your comfort zone, and seeking guidance from more experienced colleagues, you\u2019ll always be growing. And that will make you a valuable team member and contributor over the course of your entire career, no matter where you end up.<\/p>\n<p>Back when I graduated, \u201cjob-hopping\u201d was frowned upon and perceived as signaling a lack of commitment and seriousness. The average worker today has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/nlsoy.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">12 different jobs<\/a> (and counting) by the time they turn 40. Exploring new career paths and constantly evolving as a professional are now normal, expected parts of the journey. Tools like online learning give people the opportunity to reinvent themselves and create the lives they desire in a way that just wasn\u2019t possible in the past.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re 22 and just entering the world of work, go into it with an open mind and boundless curiosity. Not only will a lifelong learning attitude serve you well, it\u2019ll make the journey a lot more interesting and rewarding.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-image\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Dennis-Yang-Udemy-CEO.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63513\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Dennis-Yang-Udemy-CEO.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Yang - Udemy CEO\" width=\"170\" height=\"212\" \/><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>Dennis is an entrepreneur focused on the intersection of education and technology who\u2019s passionate about unleashing human potential and removing barriers to upward mobility.
