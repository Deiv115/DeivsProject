However, this isn\u2019t necessarily true &#8211; some MOOCs have been very well-designed, and the bar has risen, with average course production quality improving considerably. Universities, seeing both large markets and big uncertainties in the online learning world, have organized and staffed centralized departments to support professors creating these courses, including MOOCs. For example, Harvard has in-house course <a title=\"HarvardX\" href=\"http:\/\/harvardx.harvard.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">production studio<\/a> with over 50 staff, including specialists in instructional design, production, research, technical operations, and program support.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q5K1gfwEQrQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Professor Michael Goldberg of Case Western Reserve University worked with, former 60 Minutes Associate Producer and Peabody Award winner, Catherine Levy, to help produce his documentary-style video lectures for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/entpecon\">Beyond Silicon Valley: Growing Entrepreneurship in Transitioning Economies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\nSome instructors have made efforts to create specific tools to help them teach MOOCs. <span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Some instructors have made efforts to create specific tools to help them teach MOOCs.

Recently they met at the <a href=\"http:\/\/con.openedx.org\/\">first open edX conference<\/a>, with slides and recordings <a href=\"https:\/\/openedx.atlassian.net\/wiki\/display\/OPEN\/Open+edX+Conference+Presentations\">available here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3><strong>A Trend towards \u2018Always On\u2019 Availability<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\nUdacity was the first provider to adopt a self-paced model.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>MOOCs started out, and for the most part still parallel college classroom courses with a start date, end date, and specific deadlines for assignments\/homework. Udacity was the first provider to abandon this paradigm (back in 2012) and adopted a self-paced model&#8211;users can sign up and complete the courses at their own pace (which allows both flexibility for students, and happens to fit well with Udacity\u2019s monthly subscription revenue model). \u00a0This gets closer to the self-paced content available on Udemy or Lynda.com. However, to make a major jump towards this requires providing ways to supply the interaction and\/or assistance that most MOOC-takers expect. Coursera had made a big push towards \u2018on-demand\u2019 courses. At the time of writing, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/courses?courseType=v2.ondemand\">27 on-demand courses<\/a> available. Currently none of these have discussion forums (yet) or verified certificates. This is a clear boon to those students who want scheduling flexibility, but it also removes key elements that have been part of the \u201cMOOC\u201d formula that has been so popular. It also allows for sharing of individual lecture videos:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>\nCoursera&#8217;s new On-Demand courses enable you to share lectures.

FutureLearn also has plans to make all the <a href=\"https:\/\/about.futurelearn.com\/blog\/our-first-year\/\">content of their courses open<\/a>. As more of the content from these hundreds of professors and thousands of MOOCs and becomes sharable (at an increasing level of production quality), perhaps we will start to see new forms of content aggregation, a la YouTube playlists or curated libraries. Having to take (or at least sign up for and wade through) whole courses is a very large bite of content, and going down to the lecture level allows for much more interesting compilation, sharing, and re-mixing.<\/p>\n<h2>2014 a Year for MOOC Maturation<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\nUniversities are jumping on the online bandwagon and investing in online course development.\u00a0<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We have seen strong development of the MOOC ecosystem this year. MOOC providers are becoming more sure-footed in creating their business models. They will likely tune them and thus bring in even more revenues. Universities are jumping on the online bandwagon and investing in online course development. They will be eager to leverage this content (perhaps via blended learning) in their on campus and continuing education curriculum. Instructors and students are continuing to offer and take MOOCs in growing numbers. As more new courses cover the same or overlapping content and production values rise, we may start to see more options and choices that student learners have, and more \u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019 in the course offerings. It will be interesting to see how all of this plays out in 2015.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thanks to Charlie Chung for contributing to this story.<\/strong><script src=\"https:\/\/ajax.googleapis.com\/ajax\/libs\/jquery\/1.8.2\/jquery.min.js\"><\/script><br \/>\n<script src=\"https:\/\/code.highcharts.com\/highcharts.js\"><\/script><script src=\"https:\/\/code.highcharts.com\/modules\/exporting.js\"><\/script><br \/>\n<script src=\"\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/moocs.2014.js\"><\/script><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MOOC Ecosystem Makes Leap in Maturity in 2014.
