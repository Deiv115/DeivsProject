I had heard about MOOCs precisely in August of that year from a famous Italian radio broadcast.. And I thought: &#8220;Hey Cristian, but this is something you need to do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After taking the high school diploma, I could not attend a university. But just in that moment I discovered how much I loved to learn: the need to study to grow my skills. So even though in time I had become a director of a branch of my company (a highly absorbent work in terms of time), I was trying to study any subject could help me to better understand the world in which I was living in.<\/p>\n<p>As generalist manager I was very interested in understanding leadership (I was managing a group of about 20 people), communication and reasoning techniques. To deepen these topics, for years I was studying logic: still I did not know (I had only sensed) that critical thinking was one of the most important skills for a leader.<\/p>\n<p>So it was that in January 2014 I enrolled in the course of Prof. Rolf Strom-Olsen, Critical Perspective On Management (CPOM). I said to myself when I read the rubric: &#8220;This course contains everything I need to know!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2>THE COURSE<\/h2>\n<p>CPOM at that time was my third MOOC in Coursera, and since the first lesson it was immediately clear to me how powerful was the message contained in this course.<\/p>\n<p>The course is organized in 6 weeks and all the lessons are recorded in one of the classrooms of one of the most prestigious European business schools: the IE Business School of Madrid. The feeling you get is that of being a student, sitting among the desks of this prestigious institution, listening to one of the most engaging professor of ever.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Far from being monologues, Prof. Strom-Olsen\u2019s lessons are true example of Socratic dialogue.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Prof. Rolf Strom-Olsen is a great communicator. The way he introduces topics, dissects and analyzes them, is simply impressive. Far from being monologues, Prof. Strom-Olsen\u2019s lessons are true example of Socratic dialogue. CPOM follows the principles of logic: assumptions and conclusions at the end of each week, drive to new arguments for the following lessons. The course ends with a couple of case studies that demonstrate the validity of the arguments put forward during the entire course.<\/p>\n<h2>WHAT I LEARNED<\/h2>\n<p>If I had to summarize the course of Prof. Rolf Strom-Olsen in one sentence, I would say: <strong>the power of narrative<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p>If I had to summarize the course of Prof. Rolf Strom-Olsen in one sentence, I would say: <strong>the power of narrative<\/strong>.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As a young manager, I was often tempted to follow an evaluation scheme of my staff according to ranking scheme based on their performances. In CPOM is presented the case of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.workforce.com\/articles\/forced-ranking-a-good-thing-for-business\">Forced Ranking Distribution<\/a> Scheme (FRDS), a method introduced by GE\u2019s CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.it\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizkaGF3O_LAhUCQBQKHXH9AbAQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJack_Welch&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoAdskJv74dXrBtCkPBdIX7gWoCQ&amp;bvm=bv.118443451,d.bGg\">Jack Welch<\/a>, to push the competitiveness of his company through an &#8220;objective&#8221; performance evaluation of his employee. Each year 10% of the staff at the bottom of the ranking was simply asked to look for another job.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWow\u201d &#8211; many managers will say \u2013 \u201cit is brilliant! This will retain the best talent and every year there is an opportunity to recruit new ones.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But as sharply presented by Prof. Strom-Olsen, there is no scientific basis to demonstrate a close correlation between growth in business and having adopted this system for a company (just think about Google or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052702303460004579193951987616572\">Microsoft, which recently abandoned \u201cStack Ranking\u201d<\/a> ).<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the outcomes of having adopted a system of this type, only apparently have a positive impact (company point of view):<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-image\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/pyramid-upwards.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63244\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/pyramid-upwards.jpg\" alt=\"pyramid upwards\" width=\"708\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/pyramid-upwards.jpg 708w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/pyramid-upwards-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px\" \/><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While in reality the point of view of an employee is completely opposite:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-image\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/inverted-pyramid.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63246\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/inverted-pyramid.png\" alt=\"inverted pyramid\" width=\"690\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/inverted-pyramid.png 690w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/inverted-pyramid-300x185.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Pasted-image-at-2016_04_19-11_40-PM-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63235\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Pasted-image-at-2016_04_19-11_40-PM-1.png\" alt=\"Pasted image at 2016_04_19 11_40 PM (1)\" width=\"116\" height=\"38\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Would you like to work in a team who feel that way?<\/p>\n<p>Something that a true leader can\u2019t afford in the daily practice of managing within his own working environment.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the Roman grain trade, I have learned that the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/principal-agent-problem.asp\">principal-agent problem<\/a> can be overcome by building a solid culture of reputation within the company (something for which any stakeholder is willing to assign a value to).<\/p>\n<p>I learned to doubt that the word innovation in the contest of management, is something we can easily define, and I have learned to doubt that the steady growth (and sometimes not controlled) is the only way to ensure that a company can survive the changing conditions of a market.<\/p>\n<p>Is it not true that the longest living organisms are those that can best adapt to the changing environment in which they live?<\/p>\n<p>I have also learned to look at the business world with different eyes: who are the shareholders of this large corporations? What are the interests that they move? Are their interests consistent with ones of their stakeholders?<\/p>\n<p>Apparently it seems not to be so.<\/p>\n<p>Can a manager, who bases much of his wages on stock options, have a long-term vision of wellness for his own company? The increasing economic inequality in the population that we are experiencing and the constant economic crisis do not seem to provide a valid justification to the myth of these super paid CEOs.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the FDRS, growth as the only parameter of success, the self-regulating force of the market and the new myths of entrepreneurship, are a form of narrative that many managers are following without posing fundamentals questions: what does this mean? Why? Just, critical thinking!<\/p>\n<h2>WHY EVERY MANAGER SHOULD IN ENROLL<\/h2>\n<p>To me It\u2019s quite clear. Because the current narrative in terms of management is no longer reflecting economic reality (and I dare say, perhaps it never had solid basis).<\/p>\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s much better to say that the events occurred in the last fifteen years (especially since 2008) have shown us that most of the management theories were simply guided by a narrative that often have lead to unfavorable outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>Prof. Rolf. Strom-Olsen, not praise to a &#8221; happy decrease\u201d but introduces in the practice of management a more neutral concept: adaptation.<\/p>\n<p>If innovation is synonymous of granted growth, what is the correct definition of innovation? And if innovation ensures a steady growth why the lifetime of companies currently has shrunk to one third compared to thirty \/ forty years ago?<\/p>\n<p>Something that many managers and shareholders should think about for the good and their stakeholders, and for the good of their companies.<\/p>\n<p>Adaptation is a neutral term: it may mean that in some cases it is right to think of expanding a market, but in other cases it may mean redesign a business, so that it can survive to unexpected changes (new requirements, more innovative competitors, etc.), in order to enhance the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/core_competencies.asp\">core competencies <\/a>of the company and have a survival perspective (and maybe future growth).<\/p>\n<p>Yet history has shown us that many companies have pursued the narrative of growth at all costs. The results we know them all.<\/p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION<\/h2>\n<p>Critical Perspective On Management is a fundamental MOOC for any manager (whether you are a Junior or a Senior) to have a hope of a positive and fairer change for the economic future of our society.<\/p>\n<p>This is a MOOC that provide \u201cfood for thoughts\u201d in a fun, engaging and exciting way. And this is a big plus.<\/p>\n<p>To resume Socrates\u2019 quotation:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\u201cThe unexamined life is not worth living.\u201d<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Thanks for all Prof. Rolf!<\/p>\n<p>[review_widget]<\/p>\n<p><em>Class Central is looking for reviewers and regular contributors.
