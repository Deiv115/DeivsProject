The one that, when someone asks you about your college days, is the first course that comes to mind. Whether it was a groundbreaking subject or an enlightening, innovative professor, \u00a0you will look back fondly on it later in your professional career. That course and that professor, came for me in Yaser S.

While waiting for the next iteration, I read about CalTech\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/work.caltech.edu\/telecourse.html\" target=\"_blank\">Learning From Data telecourse<\/a> which happened to be two weeks in already. Since the Netflix recommendation engine was a hot topic in all of the tech blogs, I hastily signed up. I ordered the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Learning-Data-Yaser-S-Abu-Mostafa\/dp\/1600490069\/ref=asap_B007K3LFWM_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418128190&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">hardcover book<\/a> one-day-rush from Amazon, with visions of soon writing an algorithm to tell the masses what movies to watch. Truth be told, it was one of the most challenging courses I would ever take, and would set the precedent for my future interests and learning.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>&#8220;It was one of the most challenging courses I would ever take&#8221;<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The original telecourse, which is still being used, was broadcast live from the lecture hall at Caltech in April and May of 2012. In the fall of 2013 it was added to the edX platform with the same material and lectures but with a more liberal grading schema. There are many machine learning and big data courses popping up by all the MOOC providers, especially since Udacity\u2019s Data Analytics Nanodegree launch. The glaring difference between <em>Learning From Data<\/em> and the rest, is the detailed and intricate understanding it provides of the elements that make up machine learning models and algorithms. More importantly though, absolutely nothing can or will replace the ability to sit in on a graduate level course such as this, which is something MOOCs have failed to replicate.<\/p>\n<h2>Yaser S.

He received his PhD in 1983, the same year he joined the CalTech faculty.<\/p>\n<p>He founded <a href=\"https:\/\/nips.cc\/\" target=\"_blank\">NIPS<\/a>, the premiere international conference on machine learning and has written many publications. Most recently, Yaser authored an article for the Scientific American in 2012 titled \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/scientificamerican\/journal\/v307\/n1\/full\/scientificamerican0712-78.html\" target=\"_blank\">Machines can think for themselves<\/a>\u201d speaking of the history and current trajectory of self aware systems, recommendation engines and learning algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>The quality of Yaser\u2019s lectures and the development of not only the course but the original platform can best be summed up in a quote taken from an interview he did with KD Nuggets in April of 2014:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>&#8220;If you are thinking about doing an online course, do it very well or not at all. It will be a huge time sink, and it pays off only if it is truly distinguished.&#8221;<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And also, Yaser does have a sense of humour. I will leave it to you to take the course and discover it for yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>Pre-Requisites<\/h2>\n<p>For the first iteration of the Caltech telecourse taken in 2012, I had a modest familiarity of Python and PHP and no math or statistics background outside of high school. I made it about halfway before flipping the table and giving up. When the course was offered again later in the year, my ambition had not wavered, but the results were nearly identical. I finally passed <em>Learning From Data<\/em> when it moved to the edX\u00a0platform in 2013 after which I had taken Udacity\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/361\/udacity-introduction-to-statistics\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Statistics<\/a> and <a title=\"Artificial Intelligence for Robotics\" href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/mooc\/1021\/georgia-tech-online-master-of-science-in-computer-science-cs-8802-artificial-intelligence-for-robotics-programming-a-robotic-car\" target=\"_blank\">Programming a Robotic Car<\/a> courses, as well as becoming more proficient in Python. (Let\u2019s leave out the part where Yaser eased the passing percentage by about thirty points, I\u2019m sure that had nothing to do with it!)<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>To be successful you must have a good understanding of Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra and some Calculus<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To be successful you must have a good understanding of Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra and some Calculus. The syllabus states that some programming language or platform will help with the homework. I would say that this is a vast understatement. Relative expertise of at least one object-oriented or functional language is essential. Think Python, Java, R, Matlab, Octave, Haskell, etc. <em>Learning From Data<\/em> is very heavy on theory. And\u00a0 I mean all of it. This was a huge stumbling block during my first run. I was expecting something like \u201cBAM!\u201d this is how you implement Naive-Bayes, \u201cBang!\u201d this is how you do Logistic Regression. I was ill-prepared to trudge through the miles of hypotheses, mathematical notations and symbols to arrive at a proof for each machine learning concept that was introduced. The end result was magnificent as I forced myself to memorize the notation provided so kindly in the printed version of <em>Learning From Data\u2019s<\/em> glossary and develop a birds-eye understanding of Calculus.<\/p>\n<p>As LIONlab puts it:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\u201cYaser&#8217;s course is not about giving you pre-digested baby food, but about strengthening your teeth.\u201d<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Course Up Close<\/h2>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KlP0DpiM7Lw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The beginning of the course jumps right into the Perceptron Learning Algorithm and then delves into supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The first few sections are very heavy on probability distributions with bin sample problems which you can generally solve without any programming. There are a few questions on the PLA which just takes a little Python and help from Google. After that it becomes imperative to start building your own proof of concepts or seek assistance in the forums to find proven code samples. Really at no point does this course provide you with any guidance to solve the problems and it remains completely language-agnostic. It truly expects you to know on your own what programming language you will utilize and how to attack solving each problem. this is a huge departure from Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course which walks you through the Octave necessary to solve some of the homework.<\/p>\n<p>It does not become terribly clear until later on, but each week you are building a foundation and plugging ideas and proofs into this larger picture. At the end you should have several complete learning models at your disposal.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Each week you are building a foundation and plugging ideas and proofs into this larger picture<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The first half of the lectures focus on building a Linear model by properly handling probability distribution with error and noise to fill training examples which feeds into the learning algorithm, where you will inevitably arrive at your final hypothesis. The second half describes at a very high level a number of different learning models such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Radial Basis Functions.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>\u00a0With the free license to the downloadable LIONoso data visualization tools&#8230;you have the ability to import data, analyze it and view or modify your output to gain a concrete understanding of what you are learning.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One giant difference between the telecourse and the edX version, is the addition of a free license to the downloadable LIONoso data visualization tools provided by Italian data science company <a href=\"http:\/\/lionoso.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">LIONlab<\/a>. With this partnership you have the ability to import data, analyze it and view or modify your output to gain a concrete understanding of what you are learning. In the telecourse version, students were building their own visualizations and post them in the book forums for feedback. This is a huge hurdle removed for a number of students, some of whom would likely have dropped the course otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>While <em>Learning From Data<\/em> was on the Caltech telecourse platform it was far more challenging, and if my memory serves me, required a passing grade of 70% or higher. \u00a0There were weekly quizzes that typically consisted of 10 questions, plus a final exam. When the class was moved to the edX platform they eased up on the requirements and allowed for a 40% or higher to pass on the homework, dropping the lowest two scores. Unlike any MOOC I have taken before or after, you were only allowed one submission attempt. This increased the stress level to gigantic proportions. It left you sitting in front of the screen staring at your answers for hours to ensure they were at least hopefully correct. Even at 40% it was still VERY challenging.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Yaser personally responded to most forum questions at a phenomenal rate.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The syllabus states a time commitment of approximately ten to twenty hours a week. I can assure you that this was not an overstatement. There were two sets of lectures per week that clocked in around one hour each plus QA sessions. After extensive note-taking, I was able to get through the material in about five hours. The homework and research to attempt the homework took around another three to five hours. During the original telecourse, Yaser personally responded to most forum questions at a phenomenal rate. Never have I seen a professor as engaged in a distance\/remote course. Students would get detailed responses typically within an hour of posting. I am fairly certain Yaser responded faster and more effectively than what I can recall from my local community college course.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrap Up<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-left cc-blockquote-text\"><p><span style=\"color: #272c2e;\">It is akin to a really great movie, every time you watch it you discover more things visible only at a more granular level.<\/span><span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Clear your schedule and take no other classes alongside it. If for no other reason than it deserves that amount of attention. You must be a motivated learner who is able to create their own direction. The biggest challenge, other than the lack of hand-holding, is that it has the pace of a true graduate-level machine learning class. It assumes that you have the prerequisites and makes no effort give the student any background like a traditional MOOC would. Thanks in whole to <em>Learning From Data<\/em>, I have actually been able to truly understand and execute the material in the recently purchased books \u201cThoughtful Machine Learning\u201d and \u201cBuilding Machine Learning Systems With Python.\u201d I have already decided to take this class again at some point, full of new knowledge and clarity obtained since the fall 2013 iteration. It is akin to a really great movie, every time you watch it you discover more things visible only at a more granular level.<\/p>\n<h2>Classes to consider next<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/ml\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning: Coursera\/Stanford<br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/course\/neuralnets\" target=\"_blank\">Neural Networks for Machine Learning: Coursera\/UofToronto<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/ud120\" target=\"_blank\">Intro to Machine Learning: Udacity<br \/>\n<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/ud675\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning: Supervised Learning: Udacity<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/ud820\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning Udacity<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"\/\/www.udacity.com\/course\/ud741\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning Udacity<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Review of Caltech&#8217;s Introductory Machine Learning course taught by Yaser S.
