It is highly-popular across many industries, like data scientists, engineers, digital marketers, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Databases are prevalent everywhere, from websites to banking systems to video games, you name it! High volumes of data produced by billions of users are stored in databases every single day, and in order to retrieve the valuable data from these databases you\u2019ll need to learn SQL.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, databases are so important that most computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the class that taught them the most valuable skills for their careers and it\u2019s the third most popular programming language among professional developers according to <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.stackoverflow.com\/survey\/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StackOverflow\u2019s 2021 Developer Survey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, learning SQL will give you the ability to do important data work yourself, making you more appealing to any employer out there.<\/p>\n<h2>Quick Note about different SQL dialects<\/h2>\n<p>As there are many <a href=\"https:\/\/arctype.com\/blog\/sql-dialects\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">different flavors<\/a> of database management systems, there too are many different flavors of SQL, each having their own minor differences. But do not worry! The difference is extremely minor, and all SQL dialects share the same common syntax.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the courses in this ranking focus you on learning the general SQL syntax and concepts, but I\u2019ve also included some courses that are more focused on one specific flavor. Nevertheless, the SQL you\u2019ll learn in those courses will be transferable to all dialects of SQL.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

You will learn common SQL commands like SELECT and FROM to get columns from a table, use WHERE to specify a condition that needs to be met, making use of logical operators to combine conditions together.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll learn how to combine data from multiple tables together using JOIN commands, based on mathematical set operators. You\u2019ll learn how to use JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.<\/p>\n<p>One of the reasons why data scientists love SQL is its ability to perform basic statistical operations like SUM, MIN, and MAX. You\u2019ll learn how to use these aggregate functions to bring out insights from the data as well as learn a few other functions like CASE, HAVING, and DATE to furnish your toolkit.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes one query is too simple or isn\u2019t enough to get the data you need. Luckily, you can write subqueries which are nested querying methods to help you answer complex business questions. You\u2019ll also learn to use temp tables to access a table with more than one query. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn how to clean data in SQL.<\/p>\n<p>The course also includes two advanced SQL topics: one on window functions where you\u2019ll compare one row to another without doing any join, and the other on advanced joins and performance tuning which will be especially helpful for passing interviews.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 7 sections and is 4 weeks long.

You\u2019ll learn seven reasons why relational databases are so prevalent, and how these reasons manifest themselves in its design and philosophy. You\u2019ll also focus on the database management system and four key concepts: the data model, schema versus data, data definition language (DDL), and data manipulation or query language (DML).<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, you\u2019ll learn how to query relational databases in general without any focus on a specific language. You\u2019ll learn how DDL is used to design the schema of a database, and how DML is written to query and retrieve data from databases.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have become familiar with the gist behind relational databases, you\u2019ll start learning how to write SQL with the most essential statement: SELECT. Afterwards, you\u2019ll build on your knowledge of SELECT by using statements that modify the results of the query, like adding conditions with WHERE or changing the order results are displayed with ORDER BY.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll learn another important statement of SQL: JOIN. JOIN statements allow you to retrieve data spread out over multiple tables, which most databases consist of. You\u2019ll also learn about aggregation functions like SUM and DISTINCT that describe the nature of data, as well as a few commands that\u2019ll help you modify and make updates to data.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 2 weeks long with each week taking 8\u201410 hours to complete.

First, you\u2019ll learn about the structure and anatomy of a database. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to select one or more columns with the SELECT statement and get to know a few functions.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, you\u2019ll study how to filter through rows using basic comparison operators like AND, OR, and BETWEEN. You\u2019ll also learn how to filter for text and words using the WHERE statement, helping you dig up chunks of valuable information.<\/p>\n<p>In the third section, the course discusses aggregate functions that help summarize data into a simple statistic. You\u2019ll use aliases to help name your query results and make it much more readable.<\/p>\n<p>In the final section, the course teaches how to sort with ORDER BY and group results with GROUP BY. Although GROUP BY is tricky to learn at first, you\u2019ll realize how useful it is when you\u2019re filtering through two combined conditions at the same time. You\u2019ll end the course with a final exercise where you\u2019ll put everything you\u2019ve learned together.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course consists of 4 sections and is 4 hours long in total.

You will not only cover the SELECT statement for retrieving data and creating analytical reports, but also the DDL (&#8220;Data Definition Language&#8221;) and DML (&#8220;Data Manipulation Language&#8221;) commands necessary to create and maintain database objects.<\/p>\n<p>There are no prerequisites for this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with a discussion on where SQL came from, its history and its origins, before settling on the most used SQL statement\u2009\u2014\u2009SELECT. When you&#8217;re programming in SQL, a lot of what you do is going to be SELECT statements. Hence, you\u2019ll spend quite a bit of time in this course learning about the SELECT statement and all the different things you can do with the SELECT statement.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll take a look at group functions and how you can use group functions to do SubTotals. Then, you\u2019ll learn about subqueries, which can embed one query inside of another query. When the embedded query runs it returns results that are used by the outer query. You&#8217;ll also investigate how to get data from multiple database tables using the SQL Join, which are based on mathematical set operations and are really powerful for pulling data from many tables.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, you\u2019ll learn about DDL and DML, Data Definition Language and Data Manipulation Language. Essentially, these are creating, updating, modifying, and deleting tables and their records. You\u2019ll be given a few advanced SQL concepts like VIEW, CASE and UNION to practice with.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 6 weeks long with 25 hours worth of material. You\u2019ll learn primarily from watching the lecture videos and reading the assigned course materials.<\/p>\n<p>Learners will have access to a total of 13 labs, where you\u2019ll practice querying SQL commands from a database. Only paying learners however will be graded and see the solutions. In addition, paying learners will also have quizzes that\u2019ll test their understanding.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Institution<\/b><\/td>\n<td>University of Colorado Boulder<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Coursera<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Alan Paradise<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>25 hours total<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Enrollments<\/b><\/td>\n<td>8K<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Rating<\/b><\/td>\n<td>4.8 \/ 5.0 (72)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The course has 166 bookmarks on Class Central.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This course is a part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/databases-for-data-scientists-89537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Databases for Data Scientists Specialization<\/a>, with the next course in line being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/advanced-topics-future-trends-database-technologi-89680\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advanced Topics and Future Trends in Database Technologies<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this course, you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/the-structured-query-language-sql-66359\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more information about the course and how to enroll here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"anchor-9\">9. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/sql-for-data-science-9725\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SQL for Data Science (University of California, Davis)<\/a><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-80656\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/9.-SQL-for-Data-Science-University-of-California-Davis.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/9.-SQL-for-Data-Science-University-of-California-Davis.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/9.-SQL-for-Data-Science-University-of-California-Davis-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/9.-SQL-for-Data-Science-University-of-California-Davis-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/course\/sql-for-data-science-9725\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>SQL for Data Science<\/i><\/a> by the University of California, Davis is designed to give you a primer in the fundamentals of SQL and working with data from the perspective of a data scientist.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of this <b>free-to-audit <\/b>course, you\u2019ll be able to ask the right questions to deliver valuable insights for your organization, write complex queries to help you select and filter data from tables, create new tables and move data into them, and use SQL as a professional to shape your data for targeted analysis purposes.<\/p>\n<p>No prior experience with SQL is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with an explanation of what SQL is and how it differs from other computer languages (Hint: it is declarative instead of procedural!). After learning about the different relationships databases can have between one another, you\u2019ll learn how to write a SELECT statement to grab data you need from a database.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll learn a few more basic SQL clauses and operators to really supercharge your SQL abilities. You\u2019ll know how to aggregate data, filter them, sort them, and group them all within one query.<\/p>\n<p>Subqueries and joins are another powerful tool to have in your skillset. You\u2019ll know when to use subqueries to further refine your select statements, and use joins to combine and select data from two or more tables. Lastly, you\u2019ll understand the importance of using aliases, pre-qualifiers, and comments to make your SQL code cleaner.<\/p>\n<p>The last section of the course concerns modifying and analyzing data with SQL. You\u2019ll study how to modify strings by concatenating, trimming, changing the case, and using the substring function especially when it comes to date and time strings, as well as understanding case statements and data governance and profiling.
