It aims to bring modern language design and an advanced type system to systems programming.<\/p>\n<p>Rust\u2019s efficiency comes from its memory safety, which rejects the traditional garbage collector and instead manages memory via the novel concept of ownership and borrowing. In Rust, you automatically write safe, correct code thanks to its stringent but helpful compiler that exactly tells you where an error occurred in your code before the code is even run!<\/p>\n<p>Rust is frequently used to write stable, high-performance code. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rust-unofficial\/awesome-rust\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Common applications include CLI tools, networking, embedded services, and the most exciting, WebAssembly<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Although Rust is a relatively new programming language, having its first stable release in 2014, it is increasingly being embraced by more and more companies. Rust is well-loved among developers, being the most loved language 6 times in a row according to the annual <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.stackoverflow.com\/survey\/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StackOverflow Developer Survey<\/a>.

You\u2019ll then write a simple program, taking notes on handling errors in Rust using enums.<\/p>\n<p>Ownership and borrowing are essential concepts that make Rust run fast and run safe by keeping track of where data is used throughout the program. You\u2019ll uncover the rules of ownership, Rust\u2019s pointer types called references, and generic types and traits which allows a function to accept arguments of different types to help you.<\/p>\n<p>Rust, like many other languages, has modules and maintains third-party packages known to Rust as crates. You&#8217;ll learn how to organize your code in files, modules, and packages and use third-party packages from the Crates.io repository. You\u2019ll also learn about three types of testing: unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests that\u2019ll give you a heads-up whenever a new addition breaks the programs.<\/p>\n<p>In the final module, you\u2019ll develop a real-world command-line program by using tested third-party crates for command-line parsing and error handling.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 5\u20136 hours long and consists of 11 modules.

By the end of the <b>free <\/b>course, you\u2019ll have a firm understanding of Rust.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with comparing the Python and Rust languages and suggests situations where you would prefer Rust over Python before starting with programming.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll begin with the standard programming concepts like variables and numbers. You\u2019ll then look into the Rust ecosystem and discover the wealth of options available to you as a Rust programmer, like debuggers and third-party libraries.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on, you\u2019ll study a few data structures like tuples, arrays, slices, lists, and strings, which you\u2019ll get comfortable with. You\u2019ll also check how to write functions and closures and how they relate to Python\u2019s functions.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll then learn about structs, which allow you to implement your own data structures. Additionally, you\u2019ll learn about hashmaps, iterators, error handling, traits, and something which isn\u2019t available in Python: smart pointers. Most importantly, you\u2019ll implement unit tests similar to Python\u2019s and know how to debug Rust code.<\/p>\n<p>The following topics revolve around substituting common Python commands like multithreading, async, and context managers in Rust. Additionally, you\u2019ll also learn how to write Python modules in Rust and even how to embed Python into Rust!<\/p>\n<p>The last few chapters involve web development concepts like sockets, JSON, HTTP servers, and WebSockets. Finally, some topics you\u2019ll cover are graphics processing, GUI programming, plotting, and SQLite.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 14 hours long.

Next, you&#8217;ll learn how to operate these data types to produce an output. Afterward, you&#8217;ll learn about functions and how they lead to code reuse by returning values. You&#8217;ll also learn about program flow control, which includes conditionals and loops.<\/p>\n<p>The course then shifts its focus on the concept of ownership and borrowing. First, you&#8217;ll learn about variable scopes, references, and slices within the context of memory management. Then, you&#8217;ll explore the various modules and third-party libraries known as crates that you can adapt into your code and create a command line application that can read from and write to files.<\/p>\n<p>The final parts of the course cover advanced programming concepts. You&#8217;ll learn about structs that allow you to create data structures. You&#8217;ll also learn about generic types and traits which add to the functionality of structs by adding behavior. Additionally, you&#8217;ll learn about lifetimes and how they interact with the borrow checker, how enums are different from structs, how to handle errors, and Rust&#8217;s collections library.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 7 hours long and consists of 16 sections.

This is because the Rust compiler forces you to consider all the ways your program might fail, which can be frustrating while prototyping, but leads to more robust production code. Fortunately, Rust\u2019s error messages are understandable and helpful, and you\u2019ll discuss Rust\u2019s strategy for error handling.<\/p>\n<p>The course&#8217;s final unit is about lifetimes \u2014 the mechanism that the compiler uses to ensure all references are valid. The course demystifies the concept and describes scenarios when lifetime annotations are needed.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 4 hours long and consists of 4 units.
