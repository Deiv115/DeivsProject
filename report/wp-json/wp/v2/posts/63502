Mathieu is co-founder of the largest vocational EdTech platform in Europe, <a href=\"https:\/\/openclassrooms.com\/\">OpenClassrooms<\/a>. <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">No matter how far I look back, I\u2019ve always seen diplomas and degrees as the bridge between education and work. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been taught: you learn when you\u2019re young, then you get a degree, and then you apply it at work for the rest of your life.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s as if learning could only happen when we\u2019re young; it&#8217;s as if working isn\u2019t about learning, too. And it\u2019s sad.<\/p>\n<p>But things are changing fast these days. One of the merits of the whole \u201cMOOC-hype\u201d we&#8217;ve been seeing is that everyone has started to take online learning seriously. You can even get an online Stanford certificate when you\u2019ve finished a MOOC.<\/p>\n<p>However, what does a certificate really mean? How does it compare to a degree? Is it possible to deliver online degree? And what will be the meaning of our degrees\u00a0tomorrow, as the skills required for work continue to change more quickly over time?<\/p>\n<h2>How we see Degrees Today<\/h2>\n<p>Degrees are a big thing. In the workplace they can bring confidence to an employer, suggesting that \u201cour school\/university has validated this student, you can go ahead.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brands carry most of the value here. Do you have a Stanford or a Harvard degree? Good for you! Recruiters will love you. Do you come from school XYZ? Well, you\u2019ll have to work a bit harder to prove your value. Also, you will probably start at a lower wage.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-center cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Recruiters tend to put more or less emphasis on degrees depending on the country in which they operate and the local culture there. In France, you\u2019d better have a degree for everything. In the UK, it\u2019s good to have one, but you can still prove your value through practical experience.<span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Recruiters tend to put more or less emphasis on degrees\u00a0depending on the country in which they operate and the local culture there. In France, you\u2019d better have a degree for everything. In the UK, it\u2019s good to have one, but you can still prove your value through practical experience.<\/p>\n<p>To make the matter even more complex, it also depends on the corporate culture. Is it a big company? If it is,\u00a0despite some high-profile examples in Europe from the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2016\/jan\/18\/penguin-ditches-the-need-for-job-seekers-to-have-university-degrees\">Ernst &amp; Young and Penguin Random House,<\/a>\u00a0you\u2019re more likely to need a degree. Is it a startup? If it is, they probably won\u2019t care that much.<\/p>\n<h2>The Early Age of Online Learning<\/h2>\n<p>MOOCs offered certificates at the course level when they first started. These certificates only told the world that you&#8217;ve followed the course \u2014 not that you\u2019ve understood it, gained some knowledge that&#8217;s useful to a potential employer, or even succeeded in it.<\/p>\n<p>However, certificates caught students\u2019 attention, because most of the <i>perceived<\/i> value of a degree is in the brand. Suddenly, you could get a Stanford certificate for a few dollars. Was it a Stanford degree? Not at all. But did it provide some stamp of authority? Sure!<\/p>\n<p>This was a good start, but it raised concerns. Weren\u2019t universities devaluing their own degree? They probably were a bit, but there was significant pressure for higher education institutions to be online. This fueled the growth of the online learning space, with Coursera and edX being two\u00a0of the major players in the space.<\/p>\n<h2>Degrees Going Online<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"cc-blockquote cc-blockquote-right cc-blockquote-text\"><p>Most platforms now advertise their paths first <span class=\"cc-blockquote-border\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Fast-forward to today. The hype has passed, but online learning still remains strong. According to data collected by Class Central, <span style=\"color: #1155cc;\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">student<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">enrollments<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">in<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">MOOCs<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">doubled<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">in<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\"> 2015 <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">to<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">more<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">than<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\"> 35 <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/moocs-2015-stats\/\" target=\"_top\">million<\/a><\/u><\/span>. The main difference is that the focus has shifted from courses to learning paths. Most platforms now advertise their paths first (just look at the front page of Udacity or Coursera), because they feel that\u00a0this is the place from which value for learners is going to come.<\/p>\n<p>This is not only a US matter. We\u2019ve seen the same response from the European market at <a href=\"https:\/\/openclassrooms.com\/\" target=\"_top\"><span style=\"color: #1155cc;\"><u>OpenClassrooms<\/u><\/span><\/a>. Why?<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, a path is like a curriculum. You follow a series of courses and projects and, in the end, receive some validation. It\u2019s getting closer to what we\u2019ve been used to for years in the physical world, albeit online paths are usually shorter (~6 months&#8217; worth of work), can start whenever you want, and can be followed at your own pace.<\/p>\n<h2>Today: Degrees. Tomorrow: portfolios?<\/h2>\n<p>When we unveiled the first State-recognized online degree\u00a0here in France, the reaction from the students was loud and clear: \u201cYes, this is what we\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201d We\u2019ve seen some impressive growth since we\u2019ve been able to deliver a well-known degree for just a fraction of its price online \u2014 we\u2019re talking about a price that&#8217;s 80% cheaper, and for the exact same degree as what&#8217;s offered by the school in its &#8220;physical&#8221; or real world classes.<\/p>\n<p>The irony here is that degrees\u00a0are going to be seriously challenged by the market. Don\u2019t get me wrong: strong brands like Berkeley have the capacity to remain strong. However, smaller universities <i>will<\/i> see their degree challenged, because technology is evolving faster and faster, and the skills we may have learned at school are becoming obsolete at an alarming rate.<\/p>\n<p>A <span style=\"color: #1155cc;\"><u><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fya.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/fya-future-of-work-report-final-lr.pdf\" target=\"_top\">2015 <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fya.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/fya-future-of-work-report-final-lr.pdf\" target=\"_top\">Australian<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fya.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/fya-future-of-work-report-final-lr.pdf\" target=\"_top\">study<\/a><\/u><\/span> found that more than half of students today are chasing careers that will be made obsolete by advances in technology and automation over the next 10\u201315 years. This trend shows no sign of slowing down.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s a degree worth if it\u2019s obsolete in just a few years? There are two scenarios that players in the education space should consider.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Put the emphasis on the learning process itself<\/b>. At school, you should <i>learn how to learn<\/i>. That\u2019s a valuable skill: if you\u2019re able to learn fast and every day, then you know how to obtain the skills you need and at the moment you need them. A <strong>degree<\/strong>\u00a0that assesses\u00a0this ability\u00a0could resist the inevitable future changes in skills demanded by employers.<\/li>\n<li><b>Create shorter curriculum<\/b>, like the six month learning paths that are emerging online. Those can give you a new set of skills quickly. You\u2019d be able to learn at your own pace, and throughout your life. These wouldn\u2019t be degrees, but maybe we could call them <b>mini-degrees<\/b>. In fact, we already talk about specializations (Coursera) or Nanodegrees (Udacity).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These scenarios aren\u2019t antagonistic to one another. We could combine them: get a degree at school that assesses\u00a0your ability to learn, and then get mini-degree every few years in your life to keep up with the skills required in the workplace.<\/p>\n<p>Looking further ahead, most of our value will probably reside in portfolios. They will contain the proof that we have the necessary skills, by showing our skills through the projects we have achieved whilst on a learning path and throughout our careers.<\/p>\n<p>But, for years to come, degrees\u00a0are still going to be a thing. In the meantime, mini-degrees will help to bridge the gap between the monolithic nature of degree and the more fragmented, agile, and open nature of portfolios.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Degrees-Class-Central-Image-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1952\" height=\"765\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63610\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Degrees-Class-Central-Image-1.jpg\" alt=\"Degrees\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Degrees-Class-Central-Image-1.jpg 1952w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Degrees-Class-Central-Image-1-300x118.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Degrees-Class-Central-Image-1-768x301.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Degrees-Class-Central-Image-1-1024x401.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1952px) 100vw, 1952px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>This is a guest post from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mathieunebra\">Mathieu Nebra<\/a>.
