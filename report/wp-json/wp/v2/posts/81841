You\u2019ll not only get a grasp of the Kotlin language, but you\u2019ll also understand how Kotlin can interoperate with Java code, which means you can keep your Java modules the way they are.<\/p>\n<p>The course doesn\u2019t cover the programming fundamentals, so it is not suitable for beginners.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course begins with a history of the Kotlin language and why it became the preferred programming language for developing in Android. Then, you\u2019ll learn the basic syntax of Kotlin, like variables, functions, control structures, as well as extension functions that extend classes. You\u2019ll see that Kotlin is really similar to Java, and that you can even mix Java and Kotlin code in the same project as they both compile to Java Bytecode.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Java, all types are non-nullable by default. You\u2019ll learn how to create nullable types and safely work with them to prevent nasty errors like null point exceptions. You\u2019ll also explore the functional programming features in Kotlin that make it a truly modern language.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t worry, object-oriented programming is still a thing in Kotlin, although the syntax is wildly different (getters and setters aren\u2019t required!).

You\u2019ll additionally learn XML for building the interfaces. By the end of the course, you\u2019ll have the fundamentals of Kotlin to turn you from a complete novice to an accomplished Android developer.<\/p>\n<p>The <b>free<\/b> course is designed to be hands\u2013on, where you\u2019ll build the app together with the instructor step-by-step.<\/p>\n<p>No programming or Android development experience is required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll start the course by being tasked with building Bull\u2019s Eye, a simple game where players have to guess the target value using a slider. You\u2019ll understand the reason behind why most modern Android apps are developed using Kotlin.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll download and set up Android studio and download the components required to start developing Android apps. Next, you\u2019ll create a basic user interface for the Bull\u2019s Eye app. You\u2019ll do this using both XML, a markup language like HTML, and the Design View.<\/p>\n<p>In the next part of the course, you\u2019ll learn how to connect the layout you created to code to add interactivity, like displaying a popup dialog whenever a button is tapped. You\u2019ll accomplish this by learning how to work with something called an activity in Android. You\u2019ll also learn how to refactor your code to reduce the amount of lines of code it takes to implement the functionality.<\/p>\n<p>In the process of building the app, you\u2019ll learn about the basics of Kotlin. You\u2019ll learn about variables, conditional statements, loops,\u00a0 functions, classes, and other language features. You\u2019ll finally learn how to work with the Kotlin Standard Library which provides lots of tools so that you don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel for common functionalities.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 2 hours long, split into three sections.

It builds concept on concept, so that even complete beginners can grow into proficient Kotlin developers.<\/p>\n<p>No prerequisites are required to take this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>Variables, expressions, statements, and data types are the foundation of most programming languages. These combined with functions, which takes an input and returns an output, allow you to write simple programs such as calculating the perimeter of a circle. You\u2019ll also learn about conditionals that enable the program to make decisions, specifically the `when` and `if` statements.<\/p>\n<p>With these basic concepts out of the way, you can finally get a taste of object-oriented programming (OOP), a programming paradigm used especially to write graphical-based applications. This will involve learning about classes and objects. One special kind of class is enum, which is used to represent a limited number of values.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, a variable might not actually hold a value. These are called nulls, and they can sometimes be a headache to work with. You\u2019ll be instructed on how to use them effectively in your program, along with lambdas that are essentially functions without names.<\/p>\n<p>Collections are a unique way of structuring data. You\u2019ll study lists that contain sequences of values and sets which are lists that only contain unique values. You\u2019ll also learn about maps that allow you to pair values together. Then, you\u2019ll learn how to loop through them to retrieve every value from them.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you\u2019ll end the course by learning about standalone functions and object functions, along with receivers and extensions.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 2\u20133 hours long.
