Anything you can do with a GUI, PowerShell can do faster. PowerShell is a cross-platform command-line shell and scripting language commonly used for automating tedious tasks, managing system configurations, and much more. You\u2019ll find many system admins, IT managers, and developers who use PowerShell daily. And thanks to scheduling, they don\u2019t even need to lift a finger in order to run PowerShell scripts!<\/p>\n<p>Here are my top picks.

Released in 2006, it was originally used for automating administrative Windows tasks but has since expanded to include other platforms like Mac and Linux.<\/p>\n<p>Anything you can do with a GUI, PowerShell can do faster. As a command-line shell, PowerShell has clear benefits like easy automation. But it also differs from the traditional command-line shell in a few ways, like how it operates on objects over text, how it has cmdlets, and how it has many different types of commands.<\/p>\n<p>PowerShell is well-loved among sysadmins, IT managers, and developers (especially those using Windows). In fact, it is the 12th most popular language according to <a href=\"https:\/\/survey.stackoverflow.co\/2022\/#technology-top-paying-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022<\/a>. And since PowerShell has the support of Microsoft, it is clear that it will continue to be maintained and developed for years to come (the latest version of Powershell, version 7.2.7, was just released a month ago at the time of writing).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png\" alt=\"Find your next course on Class Central\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology<\/h2>\n<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.classcentral.com\/report\/category\/best-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can find them all here<\/a>).

Finally, Constructs and Patterns will teach you about lists, StringBuilders, advanced functions, redirection, error handling, regular expressions, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>The course consists of 6 modules. Each koan is represented by a failing Pester test (a PowerShell test framework). You\u2019ll learn hands-on by making those tests pass by filling out the correct answer or writing the correct code.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>GitHub<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Rain Sallow<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>N\/A<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/vexx32.github.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rain Sallow<\/a> is a PowerShell enthusiast.

By the end of the course, learners will be able to automate common administrative tasks and perform bulk operations using PowerShell.<\/p>\n<p>No prerequisite knowledge is required for this course.<\/p>\n<h3>What You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is divided into three domains: PowerShell basics, scripting basics, and practical scripting.<\/p>\n<p>The first domain dives you right into the world of PowerShell. You\u2019ll learn what PowerShell is and what it is used for, how to install it, and what are the basic configurations that you\u2019ll need to work efficiently with PowerShell.<\/p>\n<p>The second domain covers basic scripting concepts needed to automate common tasks. You\u2019ll learn about data structures like arrays and hash tables. You\u2019ll also learn about arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators. You\u2019ll also learn about flow-control statements like if, switch, foreach, for, do, and while statements. All of these concepts will help you build the best script for your automation needs.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the third domain takes scripting a step further by exploring practical uses in the real-world. For example, you\u2019ll learn how to prompt for user input, archive files by dates, and compare hash values of different objects.<\/p>\n<h3>How You\u2019ll Learn<\/h3>\n<p>This course is 8 hours long. You\u2019ll learn by watching the lecture videos and following along with the course instructor.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Provider<\/b><\/td>\n<td>itpro.tv<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Instructor<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Mike Rodrick<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Level<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Beginner<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Workload<\/b><\/td>\n<td>8 hours<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Certificate<\/b><\/td>\n<td>Paid<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3>Fun Facts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Mike Rodrick is a tech enthusiast working at ITPro.TV as a technical instructor.
